CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 occur only in KDCs\n\t    using LDAP back ends, but CVE-2011-0283 occurs in all krb5-1.9\n\t    KDCs.</p>\n\t  <p>Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are\n\t    easy to trigger manually.  The trigger for CVE-2011-0281 has\n\t    already been disclosed publicly, but that fact might not be\n\t    obvious to casual readers of the message in which it was\n\t    disclosed.  The triggers for CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0283\n\t    have not yet been disclosed publicly, but they are also\n\t    trivial.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2011-0281: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC\n\t    configured with an LDAP back end to become completely unresponsive\n\t    until restarted.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2011-0282: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC\n\t    configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a null pointer\n\t    dereference.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2011-0283: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a\n\t    krb5-1.9 KDC with any back end to crash with a null pointer\n\t    dereference.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
