For this vulnerability to be exploited,\n\t      the attacker must have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and\n\t      he must have a read access to Jenkins.</li>\n\t    <li>The second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site\n\t      scripting vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft an URL\n\t      that points to Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link,\n\t      and the attacker will be able to hijack the user session.</li>\n\t    <li>The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n\t      in the Violations plugin</li>\n\t    <li>The fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n\t      in The Continuous Integration Game plugin</li>\n\t  </ol>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
