This leads to potentially incorrect policies being\n\t    applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a\n\t    given query is planned under one role and then executed under\n\t    other roles. This scenario can happen under security definer\n\t    functions or when a common user and query is planned\n\t    initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.\n\t    Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete\n\t    otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects\n\t    only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row\n\t    security policy.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
