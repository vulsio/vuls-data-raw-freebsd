These include the\n\tinsertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN\n\theader, and TCP segmentation offload (\"TSO\").  The e1000 device model\n\tuses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when\n\tsimulating these modifications on transmitted packets.</p>\n\t<p>When checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the\n\te1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum\n\toffset in the on-stack buffer.  The offset was not validated for\n\tcertain packet types.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve\n\tprocess on the host, possibly leading to code execution in the host\n\tcontext.</p>\n\t<p>The bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on\n\tthe FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of\n\texploiting this issue.</p>\n      "
