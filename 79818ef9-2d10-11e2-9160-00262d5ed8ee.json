A valid backend login is required to exploit\n\t    this vulnerability. Credits go to Thomas Worm who discovered and\n\t    reported the issue.</p>\n\t  <p>TYPO3 Backend API - Failing to properly HTML-encode user input the\n\t    tree render API (TCA-Tree) is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\t    TYPO3 Versions below 6.0 does not make us of this API, thus is not\n\t    exploitable, if no third party extension is installed which uses\n\t    this API. A valid backend login is required to exploit this\n\t    vulnerability. Credits go to Richard Brain who discovered and\n\t    reported the issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
