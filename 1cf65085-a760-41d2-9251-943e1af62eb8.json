Most\n\t    of the time X clients and servers are run by the same user, with\n\t    the server more privileged than the clients, so this is not a\n\t    problem, but there are scenarios in which a privileged client\n\t    can be connected to an unprivileged server, for instance,\n\t    connecting a setuid X client (such as a screen lock program)\n\t    to a virtual X server (such as Xvfb or Xephyr) which the user\n\t    has modified to return invalid data, potentially allowing the\n\t    user to escalate their privileges.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
