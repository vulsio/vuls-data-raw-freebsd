If 'key-method 1' is used, this allowed an\n\t    attacker to send a malformed packet to trigger a stack buffer\n\t    overflow. [...]</p>\n\t  <p>Note that 'key-method 1' has been replaced by 'key method 2' as the\n\t    default in OpenVPN 2.0 (released on 2005-04-17), and explicitly\n\t    deprecated in 2.4 and marked for removal in 2.5. This should limit\n\t    the amount of users impacted by this issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
