We\n\t    are not aware of a possibility to exploit this vulnerability\n\t    without third party extensions being installed that put user\n\t    input in exception messages.  However, it has come to our\n\t    attention that extensions using the extbase MVC framework can\n\t    be used to exploit this vulnerability if these extensions\n\t    accept objects in controller actions.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
