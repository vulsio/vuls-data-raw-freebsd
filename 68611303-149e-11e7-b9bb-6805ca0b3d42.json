This can allow the\n\t    login of users who have no password set even if the\n\t    administrator has set $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']\n\t    to false (which is also the default).</p>\n\t  <p>This behavior depends on the PHP version used (it seems\n\t    PHP 5 is affected, while PHP 7.0 is not).</p>\n\t  <h3>Severity</h3>\n\t  <p>We consider this vulnerability to be of moderate severity.</p>\n\t  <h3>Mitigation factor</h3>\n\t  <p>Set a password for all users.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
