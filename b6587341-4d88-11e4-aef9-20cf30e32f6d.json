The overridden login name could be automatically added\n\t    to groups based on the group's regular expression setting.</p>\n\t  <h5>Cross-Site Scripting</h5>\n\t  <p>During an audit of the Bugzilla code base, several places\n\t    were found where cross-site scripting exploits could occur which\n\t    could allow an attacker to access sensitive information.</p>\n\t  <h5>Information Leak</h5>\n\t  <p>If a new comment was marked private to the insider group, and a flag\n\t    was set in the same transaction, the comment would be visible to\n\t    flag recipients even if they were not in the insider group.</p>\n\t  <h5>Social Engineering</h5>\n\t  <p>Search results can be exported as a CSV file which can then be\n\t    imported into external spreadsheet programs. Specially formatted\n\t    field values can be interpreted as formulas which can be executed\n\t    and used to attack a user's computer.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
