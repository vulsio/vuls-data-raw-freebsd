We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state in a room to a small subset of the correct state. This affects all Synapse deployments which federate with untrusted servers.</li>\n\t    <li>HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. This predominantly affects homeservers with single-sign-on enabled, but all server administrators are encouraged to upgrade.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
