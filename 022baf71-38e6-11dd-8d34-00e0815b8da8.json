This can be exploited to\n\t    manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and e.g.\n\t    potentially bypass authentication.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation requires that a MySQL database is used for\n\t    authentication and that a Non-Latin character set is selected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
