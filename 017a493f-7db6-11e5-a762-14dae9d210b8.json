Additionally, OpenAFS Rx in versions 1.5.75\n\t    through 1.5.78, 1.6.0 through 1.6.14, and 1.7.0 through 1.7.32 include\n\t    a variable-length padding at the end of the ACK packet, in an attempt to\n\t    detect the path MTU, but only four octets of the additional padding are\n\t    initialized (CVE-2015-7763).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
