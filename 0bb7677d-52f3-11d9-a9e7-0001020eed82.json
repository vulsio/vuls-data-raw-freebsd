The overflow occurs during a password change of a\n\t    principal with a certain password history state. An\n\t    administrator must have performed a certain password\n\t    policy change in order to create the vulnerable state.</p>\n\t  <p>An authenticated user, not necessarily one with\n\t    administrative privileges, could execute arbitrary code on\n\t    the KDC host, compromising an entire Kerberos realm.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
