If the user tries to initialize multiple providers at once,\n\tfor the second and subsequent devices the standard input stream will be\n\talready empty.  In this case, GELI silently uses a NULL key as the user\n\tkey file.  If the user used only a key file without a user passphrase,\n\tthe master key was encrypted with an empty key file.  This might not be\n\tnoticed if the devices were also decrypted in a batch operation.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>Some GELI providers might be silently encrypted with a NULL key\n\tfile.</p>\n      "
