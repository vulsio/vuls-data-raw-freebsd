Additionally, double-free\n\t    vulnerabilities exist in MIT Kerberos 5 library code, making\n\t    client programs and application servers vulnerable.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Double-free vulnerabilities of this type are not believed to be\n\t  exploitable for code execution on FreeBSD systems.  However,\n\t  the potential for other ill effects may exist.</p>\n      "
