This results in\n\t    uninitialized memory from the QEMU process's heap being leaked to\n\t    the domain as well as to the network.</p>\n\t  <p>A guest may be able to read sensitive host-level data relating to\n\t    itself which resides in the QEMU process.</p>\n\t  <p>Such information may include things such as information relating to\n\t    real devices backing emulated devices or passwords which the host\n\t    administrator does not intend to share with the guest admin.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
