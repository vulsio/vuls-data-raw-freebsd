CVE-2023-2455 and\n\tCVE-2016-2193 fixed most interaction between row\n\tsecurity and user ID changes. They missed cases where a\n\tsubquery, WITH query, security invoker view, or\n\tSQL-language function references a table with a\n\trow-level security policy. This has the same\n\tconsequences as the two earlier CVEs. That is to say, it\n\tleads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in\n\tcases where role-specific policies are used and a given\n\tquery is planned under one role and then executed under\n\tother roles. This scenario can happen under security\n\tdefiner functions or when a common user and query is\n\tplanned initially and then re-used across multiple SET\n\tROLEs.\n\n\tApplying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete\n\totherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases\n\tthat have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy. An\n\tattacker must tailor an attack to a particular application's pattern of\n\tquery plan reuse, user ID changes, and role-specific row security\n\tpolicies.\n\t</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
