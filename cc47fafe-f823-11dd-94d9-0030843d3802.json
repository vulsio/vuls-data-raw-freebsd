This can\n\t    be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's\n\t    browser session in context of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>An error in the \"jumpUrl\" mechanism can be exploited to read\n\t    arbitrary files from local resources by disclosing a hash secret used\n\t    to restrict file access.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
