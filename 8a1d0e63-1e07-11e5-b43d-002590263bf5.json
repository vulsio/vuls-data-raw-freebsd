During subpattern calculation of a malformed regular\n\t    expression, an offset that is used as an array index is fully\n\t    controlled and can be large enough so that unexpected heap\n\t    memory regions are accessed.</p>\n\t  <p>One could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of\n\t    the affected application's memory.</p>\n\t  <p>Such information disclosure may also be used to bypass memory\n\t    protection method such as ASLR.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
