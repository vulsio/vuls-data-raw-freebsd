This creates a window during\n\t  which an attacker could replace the file with a link to\n\t  another file.  While cvsbug(1) is based on the send-pr(1)\n\t  utility, this problem does not exist in the version of\n\t  send-pr(1) distributed with FreeBSD.<br/>\n\t  In FreeBSD 4.10 and 5.3, some additional problems exist\n\t  concerning temporary file usage in both cvsbug(1) and\n\t  send-pr(1).</p>\n\t<p>Impact</p>\n\t<p>A local attacker could cause data to be written to any file\n\t  to which the user running cvsbug(1) (or send-pr(1) in FreeBSD\n\t  4.10 and 5.3) has write access.  This may cause damage in\n\t  itself (e.g., by destroying important system files or\n\t  documents) or may be used to obtain elevated privileges.</p>\n\t<p>Workaround</p>\n\t<p>Do not use the cvsbug(1) utility on any system with untrusted\n\t  users.<br/>\n\t  Do not use the send-pr(1) utility on a FreeBSD 4.10 or 5.3\n\t  system with untrusted users.</p>\n      "
