This\n\t     can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation\n\t     fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code\n\t     execution.  Because the X server runs as setuid root in many\n\t     configurations, an attacker could potentially use this\n\t     vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
