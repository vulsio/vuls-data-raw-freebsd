In certain circumstances the user can enter a particular path that\n\t    triggers an open redirect to a malicious url.The issue is mitigated by the fact\n\t    that the user needs the administer paths permission to exploit.</p>\n\t  <p>When sending email some variables were not being sanitized for shell arguments,\n\t    which could lead to remote code execution. </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
