As the RFC specifies that the certificates in the\n\t    Certificate message are always X.509 certificates in DER format,\n\t    bugs in the decoding of PEM certificates should normally not be\n\t    triggerable via the SSL/TLS handshake.</p>\n\t  <p>Versions of PolarSSL prior to 1.1.7 in the 1.1 branch and prior\n\t    to 1.2.8 in the 1.2 branch call the generic x509parse_crt()\n\t    function for parsing during the handshake. x509parse_crt() is a\n\t    generic functions that wraps parsing of both PEM-encoded and\n\t    DER-formatted certificates. As a result it is possible to craft\n\t    a Certificate message that includes a PEM encoded certificate in\n\t    the Certificate message that triggers the infinite loop.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
