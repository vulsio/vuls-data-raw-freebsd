In some cases, Opera may incorrectly allocate\n\t    too little space for a buffer, and may then store too much of the\n\t    response in that buffer.  This causes a buffer overflow, which in\n\t    turn can lead to a memory corruption and crash.  It is possible to\n\t    use this crash to execute the overflowing data as code, which may\n\t    be controlled by an attacking site.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
