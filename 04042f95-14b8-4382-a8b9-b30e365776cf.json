Specifically, in order to exploit the\n\t     vulnerability, the puppet master must be made to invoke the\n\t     'template' or 'inline_template' functions during catalog compilation.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n\t     to connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.\n\t     Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent\n\t     could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized\n\t     to access or it could poison the puppet master's caches for any\n\t     puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs,\n\t     nodes, facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this\n\t     vulnerability varies depending on the specific configuration of the\n\t     master: for example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which\n\t     version, whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client\n\t     negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master's\n\t     SSL protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain\n\t     design weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older\n\t     versions (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable\n\t     SSLv2.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n\t     to execute arbitrary code on a puppet master that is running in the\n\t     default configuration, or an agent with `puppet kick` enabled.\n\t     Specifically, a properly authenticated and connected puppet agent\n\t     could be made to construct an HTTP PUT request for an authorized\n\t     report that actually causes the execution of arbitrary code on the\n\t     master.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By\n\t     default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report\n\t     for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The\n\t     defaults in auth.conf have been changed.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
