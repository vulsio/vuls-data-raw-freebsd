The form lifetime\n\t    is successfully deployed in frameworks like web.py or plone etc.\n\t    Proposed branch lp:~tkikuchi/mailman/form-lifetime implement\n\t    lifetime in admin, admindb, options and edithtml interfaces.\n\t    [...]</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://launchpad.net/mailman/2.1/2.1.15\">\n\t  <p>The web admin interface has been hardened against CSRF attacks by\n\t  adding a hidden, encrypted token with a time stamp to form submissions\n\t  and not accepting authentication by cookie if the token is missing,\n\t  invalid or older than the new mm_cfg.py setting FORM_LIFETIME which\n\t  defaults to one hour.  Posthumous thanks go to Tokio Kikuchi for this implementation [...].</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
