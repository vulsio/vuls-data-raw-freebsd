    "text": "\n\t<p>Problem Description:</p>\n\t<p>The nullfs(5) implementation of the VOP_LINK(9) VFS\n\t  operation does not check whether the source and target of\n\t  the link are both in the same nullfs instance.  It is\n\t  therefore possible to create a hardlink from a location in\n\t  one nullfs instance to a file in another, as long as the\n\t  underlying (source) filesystem is the same.</p>\n\t<p>Impact:</p>\n\t<p>If multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are\n\t  mounted in different locations, a user with read access to\n\t  one of these views and write access to another will be able\n\t  to create a hard link from the latter to a file in the\n\t  former, even though they are, from the user's perspective,\n\t  different filesystems.  The user may thereby gain write\n\t  access to files which are nominally on a read-only\n\t  filesystem.</p>\n      "
