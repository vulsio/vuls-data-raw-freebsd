A\n\t    detected error did not set the session into the error state\n\t    correctly and further processed the packet which leads to a null\n\t    pointer dereference. This is the packet after the initial key\n\t    exchange and doesnâ€™t require authentication.</p>\n\t  <p>This could be used for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
