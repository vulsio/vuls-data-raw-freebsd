(CVE-2024-51562)</p>\n\t<p>The virtio_vq_recordon function is subject to a time-of-check to\n\ttime-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.  (CVE-2024-51563)</p>\n\t<p>A guest can trigger an infinite loop in the hda audio driver.\n\t(CVE-2024-51564)</p>\n\t<p>The hda driver is vulnerable to a buffer over-read from a\n\tguest-controlled value.  (CVE-2024-51565)</p>\n\t<p>The NVMe driver queue processing is vulernable to guest-induced\n\tinfinite loops.  (CVE-2024-51566)</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>Malicious guest virtual machines may be able to perform a denial\n\tof service (DoS) of the bhyve host, and may read memory within the\n\tbhyve process that they should not be able to access.</p>\n      "
