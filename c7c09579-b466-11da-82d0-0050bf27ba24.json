This can be exploited to disclose the\n\t    content of arbitrary files via e.g. the \"php://\" protocol\n\t    wrapper.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 3.0.9 and\n\t    has also been reported in prior versions.</p>\n\t  <p>Provided and/or discovered by:\n\t    Paul Craig, Security-Assessment.com.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
