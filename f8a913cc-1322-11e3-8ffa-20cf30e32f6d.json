It does not take steps to ensure that the file\n\t    it has been directed at is not a symlink.  If the pid file is in a directory\n\t    writeable by unprivileged users, the destination could be replaced by a\n\t    symlink allowing for privilege escalation.  svnserve does not create a pid\n\t    file by default.</p>\n\t  <p>All versions are only vulnerable when the --pid-file=ARG option is used.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
