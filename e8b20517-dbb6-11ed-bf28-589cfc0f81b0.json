Versions\n\t  from 0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking\n\t  read operations on TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts.\n\t  Instead it entered an endless loop retrying the read operation,\n\t  consuming CPU resources.  This could be exploited for denial of\n\t  service attacks.  If trace level logging was enabled, it would also\n\t  produce an excessive amount of log output during the loop, consuming\n\t  disk space.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
