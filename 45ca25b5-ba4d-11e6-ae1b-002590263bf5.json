(The L3 entries are cached in processor registers,\n\t    and don't actually form part of the pagewalk.)</p>\n\t  <p>When running a 32-bit PV guest on a 64-bit Xen, Xen must always OR\n\t    in the USER and RW bits for L3 updates for the guest to observe\n\t    architectural behaviour. This is unsafe in combination with\n\t    recursive pagetables.</p>\n\t  <p>As there is no way to construct an L3 recursive pagetable in native\n\t    32-bit PAE mode, disallow this option in 32-bit PV guests.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their\n\t    privilege to that of the host.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
