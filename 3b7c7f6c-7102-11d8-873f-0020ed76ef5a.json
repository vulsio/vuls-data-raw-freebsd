On the next ftp log in, the user will have '/'\n\t    as their root directory.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Matt Zimmerman discovered that the cause of the bug was a\n\t  missing check for a restricted user within a code path that\n\t  is executed only when a certain error is encountered.</p>\n      "
