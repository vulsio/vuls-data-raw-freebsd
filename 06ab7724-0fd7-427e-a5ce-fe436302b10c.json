A path\n\t  traversal vulnerability allowed agents to escape whitelisted\n\t  directories to read and write to files they should not be able to\n\t  access.</p>\n\t  <p>Black Duck Hub Plugin's API endpoint was affected by an XML\n\t  External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability. This allowed an\n\t  attacker with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins parse a maliciously\n\t  crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets\n\t  from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or\n\t  denial-of-service attacks.</p>\n\t  <p>Several other lower severity issues were reported, see reference\n\t  url for details.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
