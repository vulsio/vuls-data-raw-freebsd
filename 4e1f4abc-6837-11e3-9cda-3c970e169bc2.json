CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\n\t    and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST. The first one tells libcurl to\n\t    verify the trust chain using a CA cert bundle, while the\n\t    second tells libcurl to make sure that the name fields in\n\t    the server certificate meets the criteria. Both options are\n\t    enabled by default.</p>\n\t  <p>This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled\n\t    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, libcurl mistakenly also skipped the\n\t    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check. Applications can disable\n\t    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and still achieve security by doing\n\t    the check on its own using other means.</p>\n\t  <p>The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem\n\t    as it either enables both options or disables both at the\n\t    same time.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
