Upstream is no longer active and\n\t    I do not expect any further upstream releases unless someone\n\t    from the community steps up to maintain it.</p>\n\n\t  <p>What is the impact of the issue? If you ever used any of\n\t    the publish functionality (publish to Facebook, publish to\n\t    Flickr, etc.), your passwords may have been stolen; changing\n\t    them is not a bad idea.</p>\n\n\t  <p>What is the risk of the update? Regressions. The easiest\n\t    way to validate TLS certificates was to upgrade WebKit; it\n\t    seems to work but I don't have accounts with the online\n\t    services it supports, so I don't know if photo publishing\n\t    still works properly on all the services.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
