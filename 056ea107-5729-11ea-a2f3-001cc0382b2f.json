Therefore the attack might be applicable to a scenario\n\t    where Mbed TLS is running in TrustZone secure world and the\n\t    attacker controls the normal world or possibly when Mbed TLS is\n\t    part of a hypervisor and the adversary has full control of a guest\n\t    OS.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
