Which would allow various attacks on the protocol to succeed. Details of this vulnerability are discussed in <a href=\"https://www.smacktls.com/#skip\">SKIP-TLS post</a>.</p>\n\t  <p>Mono’s implementation of SSL/TLS also contained support for the weak EXPORT cyphers and was susceptible to the <a href=\"https://www.smacktls.com/#freak\">FREAK</a> attack.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
