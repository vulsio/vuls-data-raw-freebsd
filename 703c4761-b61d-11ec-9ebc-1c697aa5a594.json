Other heap content would be\n\toverwritten if the specified size was too small.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>Users with access to the mpr, mps or mpt device node may overwrite\n\theap data, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.  Note that\n\tthe device node is only accessible to root and members of the operator\n\tgroup.</p>\n      "
