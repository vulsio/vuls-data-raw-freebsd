The randomly generated password is not\n\t    disclosed to the attacker, so this problem by itself is annoying\n\t    but not a security exploit. However, this attack coupled with a\n\t    weakness in the random number seeding in mt_rand() could be used\n\t    to predict the randomly generated password.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
