An attacker can create a large\n\tvolume of streams and immediately reset them without ever reaching the\n\tmaximum number of concurrent streams allowed for the session, causing\n\tthe Varnish server to consume unnecessary resources processing requests\n\tfor which the response will not be delivered.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
