Versions starting with\n\t10.8.0 and prior to 10.8.10 and prior have a directory traversal\n\tvulnerability inside the `ClientLogController`, specifically\n\t`/ClientLog/Document`.  When combined with a cross-site scripting\n\tvulnerability (CVE-2023-30627), this can result in file write and\n\tarbitrary code execution.  Version 10.8.10 has a patch for this\n\tissue.  There are no known workarounds.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
