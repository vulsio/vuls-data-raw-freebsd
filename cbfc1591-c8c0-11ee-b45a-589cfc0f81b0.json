The 'sharing FAQ' functionality\n\t    allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application\n\t    to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. phpMyFAQ's\n\t    user removal page allows an attacker to spoof another user's\n\t    detail, and in turn make a compelling phishing case for removing\n\t    another user's account.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
