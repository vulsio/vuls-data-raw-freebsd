An obvious example of this\n\t    is the password typed during SSH login; other examples include\n\t    obsolete session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private\n\t    halves of public keys.</p>\n\t    <p>PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key\n\t      from a disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a\n\t      copy of the private key, in the function ssh2_load_userkey. The\n\t      companion function ssh2_save_userkey (only called by PuTTYgen) can\n\t      also leak a copy, but only in the case where the file it tried to\n\t      save to could not be created.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
