By exploiting this vulnerability\n\t    within a race/initialization window, an attacker with local access\n\t    could initiate an unauthorized MCollective client connection with a\n\t    server, and thus control the mcollective plugins running on that\n\t    server. This vulnerability requires a collective be configured to\n\t    use the aes_security plugin. Puppet Enterprise and open source\n\t    MCollective are not configured to use the plugin and are not\n\t    vulnerable by default.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
