This\n\t    is to mitigate malicious SVGs which try to consume all memory, and\n\t    those which try to consume an exponential amount of CPU time.</p>\n\t  <p>Fix stack exhaustion with circular references in &lt;use&gt; elements.</p>\n\t  <p>Fix a denial-of-service condition from exponential explosion\n\t    of rendered elements, through nested use of SVG &lt;use&gt; elements in\n\t    malicious SVGs.  This is similar to the XML \"billion laughs attack\"\n\t    but for SVG instancing.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
