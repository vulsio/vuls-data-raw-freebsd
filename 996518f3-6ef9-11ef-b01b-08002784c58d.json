The vulnerability is\n\t      due to an out of bounds read. An attacker could exploit\n\t      this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to\n\t      be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit\n\t      could allow the attacker to terminate the scanning\n\t      process.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2024-20506</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam\n\t      AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an authenticated, local\n\t      attacker to corrupt critical system files. The\n\t      vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to\n\t      write to its log file while privileged without checking\n\t      if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic\n\t      link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if\n\t      they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a\n\t      critical system file and then find a way to restart the\n\t      ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to\n\t      corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log\n\t      messages after restart.\n\t    </dd>\n\t  </dl>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
