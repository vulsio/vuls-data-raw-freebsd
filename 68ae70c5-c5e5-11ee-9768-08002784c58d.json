This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check\n\t      for end-of-string values during scanning, which may\n\t      result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could\n\t      exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file\n\t      containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an\n\t      affected device. A successful exploit could allow the\n\t      attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to\n\t      terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected\n\t      software and consuming available system resources.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2024-20328</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the\n\t      \"VirusEvent\" feature of ClamAV's ClamD\n\t      service. To fix this issue, we disabled the '%f' format\n\t      string parameter.\t ClamD administrators may continue to\n\t      use the `CLAM_VIRUSEVENT_FILENAME` environment variable,\n\t      instead of '%f'. But you should do so only from within\n\t      an executable, such as a Python script, and not directly\n\t      in the clamd.conf \"VirusEvent\" command.\n\t    </dd>\n\t  </dl>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
