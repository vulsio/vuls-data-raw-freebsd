This array is leaked on domain\n\t    teardown. This memory leak could -- over time -- exhaust the host's\n\t    memory.</p>\n\t  <p>A domain given partial management control via XEN_DOMCTL_max_vcpus\n\t    can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system. The\n\t    ability to also restart or create suitable domains is also required\n\t    to fully exploit the issue.  Without this the leak is limited to a\n\t    small multiple of the maximum number of vcpus for the domain. The\n\t    maximum leak is 64kbytes per domain (re)boot (less on ARM).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
