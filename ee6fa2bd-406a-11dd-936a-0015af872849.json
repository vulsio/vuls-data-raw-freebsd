The attacker\n\t  can use this attack to gain access to sensitive\n\t  information. Functions utilizing\n\t  <code>expand_filepath()</code> may be affected.</p>\n\t<p>It should be noted that this vulnerability is not\n\t  considered to be serious by the FreeBSD Security Team,\n\t  since <code>safe_mode</code> and <code>open_basedir</code>\n\t  are insecure by design and should not be relied upon.</p>\n      "
