A successful attack needs on average 2^20 messages. In\n\t    practice only automated systems will be affected as humans will\n\t    not be willing to process this many messages.</p>\n\t  <p>SSL/TLS applications are *NOT* affected by this problem since\n\t    the SSL/TLS code does not use the PKCS#7 or CMS decryption\n\t    code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
