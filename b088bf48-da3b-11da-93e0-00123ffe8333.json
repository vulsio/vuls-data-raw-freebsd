This can be\n\t    exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when the HTTP\n\t    headers received from a web server exceeds 8KB.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation requires that Freshclam is used to\n\t    download virus signature updates from a malicious mirror web\n\t    server e.g. via DNS poisoning.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
