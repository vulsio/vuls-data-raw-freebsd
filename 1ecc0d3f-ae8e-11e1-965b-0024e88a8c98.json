Recursive\n\t  servers may crash or disclose some portion of memory to the client.\n\t  Secondary servers may crash on restart after transferring a zone\n\t  containing these records. Master servers may corrupt zone data if the\n\t  zone option \"auto-dnssec\" is set to \"maintain\". Other unexpected\n\t  problems that are not listed here may also be encountered.</p>\n\t  <p>Impact: This issue primarily affects recursive nameservers.\n\t  Authoritative nameservers will only be impacted if an administrator\n\t  configures experimental record types with no data. If the server is\n\t  configured this way, then secondaries can crash on restart after\n\t  transferring that zone. Zone data on the master can become corrupted if\n\t  the zone with those records has named configured to manage the DNSSEC\n\t  key rotation.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
