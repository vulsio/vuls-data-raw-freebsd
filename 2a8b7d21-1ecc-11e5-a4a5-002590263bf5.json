Morelle reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=42776\">\n\t  <p>As mentioned in the Wesnoth 1.12.4 and Wesnoth 1.13.1 release\n\t    announcements, a security vulnerability targeting add-on authors\n\t    was found (bug #23504) which allowed a malicious user to obtain\n\t    add-on server passphrases from the client's .pbl files and transmit\n\t    them over the network, or store them in saved game files intended\n\t    to be shared by the victim. This vulnerability affects all existing\n\t    releases up to and including versions 1.12.2 and 1.13.0.\n\t    Additionally, version 1.12.3 included only a partial fix that failed\n\t    to guard users against attempts to read from .pbl files with an\n\t    uppercase or mixed-case extension. CVE-2015-5069 and CVE-2015-5070\n\t    have been assigned to the vulnerability affecting .pbl files with a\n\t    lowercase extension, and .pbl files with an uppercase or mixed-case\n\t    extension, respectively.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
