We treat all such memory faults as\n\t    potentially exploitable. This bug could be reached by an attacker\n\t    with access to the agent socket.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    On modern operating systems where the OS can provide information\n\t    about the user identity connected to a socket, OpenSSH ssh-agent\n\t    and sshd limit agent socket access only to the originating user\n\t    and root. Additional mitigation may be afforded by the system's\n\t    malloc(3)/free(3) implementation, if it detects double-free\n\t    conditions.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The most likely scenario for exploitation is a user forwarding an\n\t    agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a\n\t    host with an attacker holding root access.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
