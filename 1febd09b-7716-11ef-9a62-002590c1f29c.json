An insufficient\n\tboundary validation in the USB code could lead to an out-of-bounds read\n\ton the heap, which could potentially lead to an arbitrary write and\n\tremote code execution.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit\n\tthe vulnerability to crash the hypervisor process or potentially achieve\n\tcode execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which\n\ttypically runs as root.  Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so\n\tmalicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve\n\tprocess.</p>\n      "
