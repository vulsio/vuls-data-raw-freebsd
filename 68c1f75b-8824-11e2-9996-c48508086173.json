This flaw could be exploited to carry out a\n\t    denial of service attack against code that uses arbitrary\n\t    user input as hash keys.</p>\n\t  <p>Because using user-provided strings as hash keys is a\n\t    very common operation, we urge users of perl to update their\n\t    perl executable as soon as possible.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
