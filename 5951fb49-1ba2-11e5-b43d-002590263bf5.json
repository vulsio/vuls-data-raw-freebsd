These requests could\n\t    cause data loss or compromise.</p>\n\t  <p>Remediation Summary: Users should either set \"http.cors.enabled\" to\n\t    false, or set \"http.cors.allow-origin\" to the value of the server\n\t    that should be allowed access, such as localhost or a server hosting\n\t    Kibana. Disabling CORS entirely with the former setting is more\n\t    secure, but may not be suitable for all use cases.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
