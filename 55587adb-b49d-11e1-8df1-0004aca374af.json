In a\n\t    default/typical MantisBT installation, SOAP API is enabled and any\n\t    user can sign up to report new issues. This vulnerability therefore\n\t    impacts upon many public facing MantisBT installations.</p>\n\t  <p>Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the\n\t    delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when\n\t    a user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more\n\t    generic update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead.\n\t    MantisBT administrators may have been under the false impression\n\t    that their configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was\n\t    successfully preventing unwanted users from deleting\n\t    attachments.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
