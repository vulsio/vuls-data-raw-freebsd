A configured\n\t    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer could send a\n\t    Route-Refresh message with specially-crafted Outbound\n\t    Route Filtering (ORF) record, which would cause the\n\t    master BGP daemon (bgpd) to crash or, possibly, execute\n\t    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\n\t    bgpd.</p>\n\t  <p>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way\n\t    Quagga's bgpd daemon parsed paths of autonomous systems\n\t    (AS). A configured BGP peer could send a BGP update AS\n\t    path request with unknown AS type, which could lead to\n\t    denial of service (bgpd daemon crash).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
