Research discovered that the function\n\t    has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit. Because the\n\t    function allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was\n\t    possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to\n\t    \"fix\" the broken markup into valid markup. As a result a\n\t    motivated attacker may be able to inject javascript.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
