This may be used to launch phising\n\t    attacks by sending HTML e-mails (i.e.: saying that you\n\t    need to upgrade to the latest GForge version due to a\n\t    security problem) and putting in the e-mail an HTML link\n\t    that points to an specially crafted url that inserts an\n\t    html form in the GForge login page and when the user press\n\t    the login button, he/she send the credentials to the\n\t    attackers website.</p>\n\n\t  <p>The 'forgot your password?' feature allows a remote user\n\t    to load a certain URL to cause the service to send a\n\t    validation e-mail to the specified user's e-mail address.\n\t    There is no limit to the number of messages sent over a\n\t    period of time, so a remote user can flood the target\n\t    user's secondary e-mail address.
