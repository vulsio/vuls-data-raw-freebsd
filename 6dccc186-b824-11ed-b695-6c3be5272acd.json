The vulnerability was possible due to React’s render\n\t  cycle that will pass through the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle,\n\t  the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana’s database.</p>\n\t  <p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Medium\n\t  (CVSS:6.4/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
