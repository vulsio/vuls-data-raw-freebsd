These vulnerabilities could\n\t    cause the application to crash and could potentially allow an\n\t    attacker to take control of the affected system.  There are\n\t    reports of malware attempting to exploit one of the\n\t    vulnerabilities, CVE-2011-0627, in the wild via a Flash (.swf)\n\t    file embedded in a Microsoft Word (.doc) or Microsoft Excel\n\t    (.xls) file delivered as an email attachment targeting the\n\t    Windows platform.  However, to date, Adobe has not obtained a\n\t    sample that successfully completes an attack.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
