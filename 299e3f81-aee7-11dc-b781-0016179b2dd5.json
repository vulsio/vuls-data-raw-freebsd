Ts'o reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=2406&amp;release_id=560230\">\n\t  <p>Fix a potential security vulnerability where an untrusted\n\t    filesystem can be corrupted in such a way that a program using\n\t    libext2fs will allocate a buffer which is far too small.  This\n\t    can lead to either a crash or potentially a heap-based buffer\n\t    overflow crash.  No known exploits exist, but main concern is\n\t    where an untrusted user who possesses privileged access in a\n\t    guest Xen environment could corrupt a filesystem which is then\n\t    accessed by thus allowing the untrusted user to gain privileged\n\t    access in the host OS.  Thanks to the McAfee AVERT Research group\n\t    for reporting this issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
