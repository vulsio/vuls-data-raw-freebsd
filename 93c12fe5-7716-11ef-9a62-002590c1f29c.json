		"text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description:</h1>\n\t<p>A malicious value of size in a structure of packed libnv can\n\tcause an integer overflow, leading to the allocation of a smaller\n\tbuffer than required for the parsed data.  The introduced check was\n\tincorrect, as it took into account the size of the pointer, not the\n\tstructure.  This vulnerability affects both kernel and userland.</p>\n\t<p>This issue was originally intended to be addressed as part of\n\tFreeBSD-SA-24:09.libnv, but due to a logic issue, this issue was\n\tnot properly addressed.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>It is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory\n\t(in userland or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller\n\tthan the data received from a malicious process.  This vulnerability\n\tcould result in privilege escalation or cause a system panic.</p>\n      "
