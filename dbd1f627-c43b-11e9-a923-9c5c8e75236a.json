The issue has been resolved by respecting that limit.</li>\n\t    <li> The zip bomb vulnerability mitigated in 0.101.3 has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-12625. Unfortunately, a workaround for the zip-bomb mitigation was immediately identified. To remediate the zip-bomb scan time issue, a scan time limit has been introduced in 0.101.4. This limit now resolves ClamAV's vulnerability to CVE-2019-12625.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
