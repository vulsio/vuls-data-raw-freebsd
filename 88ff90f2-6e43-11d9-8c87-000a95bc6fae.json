This file is insecurely created in\n\t    /tmp and it's name is easily predictable.</p>\n\t  <p>It is then easy for an attacker to create arbitrary files\n\t    in any directory that the user under which apache runs has\n\t    privileges to write.</p>\n\t  <p><em>[...]</em> once the target file is opened, there is a\n\t    race attack (although difficult to exploit) which can lead\n\t    to mod_dosevasive overwriting any file that the user under\n\t    which apache runs has privileges to write.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
