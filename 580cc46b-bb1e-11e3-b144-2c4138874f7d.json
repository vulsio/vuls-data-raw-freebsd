The\n\t    vulnerability is caused by lack of proper expansion for the\n\t    string passed to the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes()\n\t    function.</p>\n\t  <p>A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of\n\t    percent-encoded characters in a URL, can be used to trigger\n\t    the overflow.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
