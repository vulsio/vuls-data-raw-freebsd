We do not believe this to be a considerable risk for applications as the likelihood of it being triggered is minimal.\n</p>\n<p>Specifically, the problem is around using QProcess to start an application without having an absolute path, and as a result, it depends on it finding it in the PATH environment variable. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to place their copy of the executable in question inside the working/current directory for the QProcess and have it invoked that instead.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
