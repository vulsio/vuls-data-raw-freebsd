This can lead to Zeek allocating\n\t  large amounts of memory for these responses and never\n\t  deallocating them. </p>\n\t  <p> A specially-crafted stream of RDP packets can cause\n\t  Zeek to spend large protocol validation. </p>\n\t  <p> A specially-crafted stream of SMTP packets can cause\n\t  Zeek to spend large amounts of time processing data. </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
