Insufficient input validation was being\n\t    done in the EAP-MSCHAPv2 state machine.  A malicious\n\t    attacker could manipulate their EAP-MSCHAPv2 client state\n\t    machine to potentially convince the server to bypass\n\t    authentication checks.  This bypassing could also result\n\t    in the server crashing</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
