The vulnerability detailed\n\t  in CVE-2011-0411 affects the STARTTLS and AUTHINFO SASL\n\t  commands.  nnrpd now resets its read buffer upon\n\t  a successful negotiation of a TLS layer.  It prevents\n\t  malicious commands, sent unencrypted, from being executed\n\t  in the new encrypted state of the session.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
