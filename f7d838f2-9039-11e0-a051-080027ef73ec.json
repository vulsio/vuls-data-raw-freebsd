However, the actual\n\t    S(TART)TLS-initiated in-band SSL/TLS negotiation was not guarded\n\t    by a timeout.</p>\n\t  <p>Depending on the operating system defaults as to TCP stream\n\t    keepalive mode, fetchmail hangs in excess of one week after\n\t    sending STARTTLS were observed if the connection failed without\n\t    notifying the operating system, for instance, through network\n\t    outages or hard server crashes.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious server that does not respond, at the network level,\n\t    after acknowledging fetchmail's STARTTLS or STLS request, can\n\t    hold fetchmail in this protocol state, and thus render fetchmail\n\t    unable to complete the poll, or proceed to the next server,\n\t    effecting a denial of service.</p>\n\t  <p>SSL-wrapped mode on dedicated ports was unaffected by this\n\t    problem, so can be used as a workaround.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
