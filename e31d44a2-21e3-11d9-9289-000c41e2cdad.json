A race condition\n\t    exists when the -k command-line option is used to kill\n\t    existing imwheel processes. This race condition may be\n\t    used by a local user to Denial of Service another user\n\t    using imwheel, lead to resource exhaustion of the host\n\t    system, or append data to arbitrary files.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
