This\n\t    can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code,\n\t    which will be executed in a user's browser session in context\n\t    of an affected site when the malicious data is being\n\t    viewed.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation requires \"list owner\" permissions.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
