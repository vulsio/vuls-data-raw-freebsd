The vulnerability is caused due to a\n\t      boundary error within the process_path function in\n\t      gmetad/server.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based\n\t      buffer overflow by e.g. sending a specially crafted message to\n\t      the gmetad service.</p>\n\t    <p>The vulnerability is confirmed in version 3.1.1. Other\n\t      versions may also be affected.</p>\n\t  </blockquote>\n       "
