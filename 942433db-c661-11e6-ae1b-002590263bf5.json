SYSCALL (and SYSRET, although we don't\n\t    implement it) behave differently because the typical behaviour\n\t    allows userspace to escalate its privilege. (This difference in\n\t    behaviour seems to be undocumented.) Xen wrongly raised the\n\t    exception based on the flags at the start of the instruction.</p>\n\t  <p>Guest userspace which can invoke the instruction emulator can use\n\t    this flaw to escalate its privilege to that of the guest kernel.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
