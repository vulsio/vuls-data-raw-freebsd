The TLS certificate validation in all Icinga\n\t2 versions starting from 2.4.0 was flawed, allowing an attacker to\n\timpersonate both trusted cluster nodes as well as any API users\n\tthat use TLS client certificates for authentication (ApiUser objects\n\twith the client_cn attribute set).  This vulnerability has been\n\tfixed in v2.14.3, v2.13.10, v2.12.11, and v2.11.12.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
