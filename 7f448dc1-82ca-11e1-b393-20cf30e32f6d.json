If a user visits an HTML page\n\t      with some malicious HTML code in it, an attacker could make\n\t      changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on behalf of the\n\t      victim's account by using the XML-RPC API on a site running\n\t      mod_perl.  Sites running under mod_cgi are not affected.\n\t      Also, the user would have had to be already logged in to the\n\t      target site for the vulnerability to work.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t  <p>All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon\n\t    as possible.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
