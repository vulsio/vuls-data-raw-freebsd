The vulnerabilities apply to those points:</p>\n\t  <ol>\n\t    <li>css/phpmyadmin.css.php was vulnerable against\n\t      <code>$cfg</code> and <code>GLOBALS</code> variable\n\t      injections. This way, a possible attacker could\n\t      manipulate any configuration parameter. Using\n\t      phpMyAdmin's theming mechanism, he was able to include\n\t      arbitrary files. This is especially dangerous if php is\n\t      not running in safe mode.</li>\n\t    <li>A possible attacker could manipulate phpMyAdmin's\n\t      localized strings via the URL and inject harmful\n\t      JavaScript code this way, which could be used for XSS\n\t      attacks.</li>\n\t  </ol>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
