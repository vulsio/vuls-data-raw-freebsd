This means that\n\t    on most servers, a cookie with the same name as one of\n\t    phpMyAdmin's parameters can interfere.</p>\n\t  <p>Another application could set a cookie for the root path\n\t    \"/\" with a \"sql_query\" name, therefore overriding the\n\t    user-submitted sql_query because by default, the $_REQUEST\n\t    superglobal imports first GET, then POST then COOKIE data.</p>\n\t  <h3>Mitigation factor</h3>\n\t  <p>An attacker must trick the victim into visiting a page on\n\t    the same web server where he has placed code that creates\n\t    a malicious cookie.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
