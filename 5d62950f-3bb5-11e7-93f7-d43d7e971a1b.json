This vulnerability could\n    allow a user with access to assign ownership of an issue or merge request to\n    another user to disclose that user's private token, email token, email\n    address, and encrypted OTP secret. Reporter-level access to a GitLab project\n    is required to exploit this flaw.</p>\n    <h1>SSRF when importing a project from a Repo by URL</h1>\n    <p>GitLab instances that have enabled project imports using \"Repo by URL\"\n    were vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery attacks. By specifying a\n    project import URL of localhost an attacker could target services that are\n    bound to the local interface of the server. These services often do not\n    require authentication. Depending on the service an attacker might be able\n    craft an attack using the project import request URL.</p>\n    <h1>Links in Environments tab vulnerable to tabnabbing</h1>\n    <p>edio via HackerOne reported that user-configured Environment links\n    include target=_blank but do not also include rel: noopener\n    noreferrer. Anyone clicking on these links may therefore be subjected to\n    tabnabbing attacks where a link back to the requesting page is maintained\n    and can be manipulated by the target server.</p>\n    <h1>Accounts with email set to \"Do not show on profile\" have addresses\n    exposed in public atom feed</h1>\n    <p>Several GitLab users reported that even with \"Do not show on profile\"\n    configured for their email addresses those addresses were still being leaked\n    in Atom feeds if they commented on a public project.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
