Fixed by limiting the\n\t    user CPU time per single script execution and cumulatively over\n\t    several script runs within a configurable timeout period. Sufficiently\n\t    large CPU time usage is summed in the Sieve script binary and execution\n\t    is blocked when the sum exceeds the limit within that time. The block\n\t    is lifted when the script is updated after the resource usage times out.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
