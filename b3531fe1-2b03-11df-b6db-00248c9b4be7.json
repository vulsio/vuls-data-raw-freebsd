The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet\n\t    installed.</p>\n\t  <p>The API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack.\n\t    An attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal\n\t    site to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL. No user\n\t    submitted data will be sent to that URL.</p>\n\t  <p>Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the\n\t    display of language codes, native and English language names properly.\n\t    While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary\n\t    administrator input is allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the\n\t    fact that the attacker must have a role with the 'administer\n\t    languages' permission.</p>\n\t  <p>Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is\n\t    blocked can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being\n\t    blocked.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
