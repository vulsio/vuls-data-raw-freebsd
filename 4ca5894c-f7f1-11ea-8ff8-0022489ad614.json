This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling as it is a non-standard interpretation of the header.</p>\n\t  <p>Impacts:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>All versions of the 14.x and 12.x releases line</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t  <h1>Denial of Service by resource exhaustion CWE-400 due to unfinished HTTP/1.1 requests (Critical) (CVE-2020-8251)</h1>\n\t  <p>Node.js is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DOS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections. The fix a new http.Server option called requestTimeout with a default value of 0 which means it is disabled by default. This should be set when Node.js is used as an edge server, for more details refer to the documentation.</p>\n\t  <p>Impacts:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>All versions of the 14.x release line</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t  <h1>fs.realpath.native on may cause buffer overflow (Medium) (CVE-2020-8252)</h1>\n\t  <p>libuv's realpath implementation incorrectly determined the buffer size which can result in a buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.</p>\n\t  <p>Impacts:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>All versions of the 10.x release line</li>\n\t    <li>All versions of the 12.x release line</li>\n\t    <li>All versions of the 14.x release line before 14.9.0</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
