An attacker being able to submit\n\t    print jobs could exploit this flaw to crash texttopdf or,\n\t    possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Till Kamppeter reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7363\">\n\t  <p>texttopdf: Fixed buffer overflow on size allocation of texttopdf\n\t    when working with extremely small line sizes, which causes the size\n\t    calculation to result in 0 (CVE-2015-3258, thanks to Stefan\n\t    Cornelius from Red Hat for the patch).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
