A malicious attacker can send packets with\n\t    escape sequence payloads to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>If Hafiye has been started with -n packet count option ,\n\t    the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.  For\n\t    remote code execution the victim must press Enter after\n\t    program exit.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Note that it appears that this bug can only be exploited in\n\t  conjunction with a terminal emulator that honors the\n\t  appropriate escape sequences.</p>\n      "
