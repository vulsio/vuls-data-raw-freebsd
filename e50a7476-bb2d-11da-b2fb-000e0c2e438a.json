		"text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description</h1>\n\t<p>IPsec provides an anti-replay service which when enabled\n\t  prevents an attacker from successfully executing a replay\n\t  attack.  This is done through the verification of sequence\n\t  numbers.  A programming error in the fast_ipsec(4)\n\t  implementation results in the sequence number associated with\n\t  a Security Association not being updated, allowing packets to\n\t  unconditionally pass sequence number verification checks.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker able to intercept IPSec packets can replay\n\t  them.  If higher level protocols which do not provide any\n\t  protection against packet replays (e.g., UDP) are used, this\n\t  may have a variety of effects.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround</h1>\n\t<p>No workaround is available.</p>\n      "
