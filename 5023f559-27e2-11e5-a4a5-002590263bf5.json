When the access size is unsupported these routines failed to\n\t    set the data to be returned to the guest for read accesses, so that\n\t    hypervisor stack contents are copied into the destination of the\n\t    operation, thus becoming visible to the guest.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious HVM guest might be able to read sensitive data relating\n\t    to other guests.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
