Due to incorrect\n\t  handling of IP fragments, this pointer fails to get\n\t  initialized.</p>\n\t<p>Impact:</p>\n\t<p>An attacker can cause the firewall to crash by sending ICMP\n\t  IP fragments to or through firewalls which match any reset,\n\t  reject or unreach actions.</p>\n\t<p>Workaround:</p>\n\t<p>Change any reset, reject or unreach actions to deny. It\n\t  should be noted that this will result in packets being\n\t  silently discarded.</p>\n      "
