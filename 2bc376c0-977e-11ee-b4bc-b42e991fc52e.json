If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled\n\tin ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is\n\tdone by verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID\n\tis listed in zoo.cfg server list.  The instance part in SASL auth\n\tID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM',\n\tthe authorization check will be skipped.As a result an arbitrary\n\tendpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit\n\tchanges to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write\n\taccess to the data tree.Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled\n\tby default.\n\tUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2,\n\twhich fixes the issue.\n\tAlternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is\n\tprotected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.\n\tSee the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.\n\t</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
