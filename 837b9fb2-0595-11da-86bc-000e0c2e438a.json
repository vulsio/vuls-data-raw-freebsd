Due to erronous analysis performed when zlib was\n\t  written, this buffer, which was belived to be sufficiently\n\t  large to handle any possible input stream, is in fact too\n\t  small.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact</h1>\n\t<p>A carefully constructed compressed data stream can result in\n\t  zlib overwriting some data structures.  This may cause\n\t  applications to halt, resulting in a denial of service; or\n\t  it may result in an attacker gaining elevated privileges.</p>\n      "
