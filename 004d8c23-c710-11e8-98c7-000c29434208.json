Admin users with the\n\t    view (but not change) permission to the user model were displayed the entire\n\t    hash. While it's typically infeasible to reverse a strong password hash, if\n\t    your site uses weaker password hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA1, it\n\t    could be a problem.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
