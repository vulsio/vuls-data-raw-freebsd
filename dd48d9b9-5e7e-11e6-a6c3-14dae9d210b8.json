For each SCTP session, there are two\n\t  separate instances in which a 4-byte fragment may be transmitted.</p>\n\t<p>This memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the\n\t  file cache or terminal buffers.  This information might be directly\n\t  useful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in\n\t  some way.  For example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered\n\t  password.</p>\n      "
