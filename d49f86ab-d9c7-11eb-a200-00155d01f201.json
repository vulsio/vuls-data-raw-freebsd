The heap\n\t    overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of\n\t    a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the\n\t    vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim\n\t    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The out-of-bounds read\n\t    is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted\n\t    image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability\n\t    to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick\n\t    the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The read of\n\t    uninitialized memory is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the\n\t    metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially\n\t    exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if\n\t    they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image\n\t    file.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
