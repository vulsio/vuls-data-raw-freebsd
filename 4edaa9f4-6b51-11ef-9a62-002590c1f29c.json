An insufficient\n\tboundary validation in the USB code could lead to an out-of-bounds\n\twrite on the heap, with data controlled by the caller.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can\n\texploit the vulnerability to achieve code execution on the host in\n\tthe bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root.  Note\n\tthat bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained\n\tby the capabilities available to the bhyve process.</p>\n      "
