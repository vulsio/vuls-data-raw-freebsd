If the system is not using stubdomains, this will be in\n\t    domain 0.</p>\n\t  <p>A privileged guest user could use CVE-2016-3712 to cause potential\n\t    integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu, resulting in a DoS\n\t    of the guest itself.  More dangerous effect, such as data leakage or\n\t    code execution, are not known but cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
