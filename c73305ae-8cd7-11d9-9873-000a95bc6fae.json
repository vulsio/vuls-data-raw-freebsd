RealNetworks has received no reports\n\t     of machines compromised as a result of the now-remedied\n\t     vulnerabilities. RealNetworks takes all security\n\t     vulnerabilities very seriously.</p>\n\t  <p>The specific exploits were:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li><strong>Exploit 1:</strong> To fashion a malicious WAV\n\t      file to cause a buffer overflow which could have allowed\n\t      an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a customer's\n\t      machine.</li>\n\t    <li><strong>Exploit 2:</strong> To fashion a malicious\n\t      SMIL file to cause a buffer overflow which could have\n\t      allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a\n\t      customer's machine.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
