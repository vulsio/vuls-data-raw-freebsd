This can be exploited to corrupt memory\n\t    and cause a crash via specially crafted XMPP or Sametime\n\t    packets.</p>\n\t  <p>A boundary error in the \"decrypt_out()\" function can be exploited\n\t    to cause a stack-based buffer overflow with 8 bytes and crash the\n\t    application via a specially crafted QQ packet.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
