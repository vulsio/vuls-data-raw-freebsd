A remote\n\t    attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an\n\t    application, linked against libxml, would lead to that application crash, or,\n\t    potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running\n\t    the application.</p>\n\t  <p>Note: The flaw to be exploited requires the particular application, linked\n\t    against libxml, to use the XPointer evaluation functionality.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
