The result was that an active network attacker could send application data to Node.js using the TLS or HTTP2 modules in a way that bypassed TLS authentication and encryption.</p>\n\t  <h1>Uninitialized buffer vulnerability - CVE-2017-15897</h1>\n\t  <p>Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not be initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the encoding specified. For example, 'Buffer.alloc(0x100, \"This is not correctly encoded\", \"hex\");' The buffer implementation was updated such that the buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.</p>\n\t  <h1>Also included in OpenSSL update - CVE 2017-3738</h1>\n\t  <p>Note that CVE 2017-3738 of OpenSSL-1.0.2 affected Node but it was low severity.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
