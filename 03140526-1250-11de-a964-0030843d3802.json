This can be exploited to inject and\n\t    execute arbitrary PHP code.</p>\n\t  <p>The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP\n\t    requests without performing any validity checks to verify the\n\t    requests. This can be exploited to e.g. create users by enticing a\n\t    logged in administrator to visit a malicious web page.</p>\n\t  <p>Input passed to the \"srclang\" parameter in locales.php (when \"next\"\n\t    is set to a non-NULL value) is not properly verified before being used\n\t    to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files\n\t    from local resources via directory traversal attacks and URL-encoded\n\t    NULL bytes.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
