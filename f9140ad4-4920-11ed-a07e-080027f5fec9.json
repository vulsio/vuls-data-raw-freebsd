A user who has been requested to change their\n\t      password can exploit this to obtain and use tickets to\n\t      other services.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2022-32744</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key\n\t      known to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests with\n\t      its own key, a user can change the passwords of other\n\t      users, enabling full domain takeover.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2022-32745</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      Samba AD users can cause the server to access\n\t      uninitialised data with an LDAP add or modify request,\n\t      usually resulting in a segmentation fault.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2022-32746</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      The AD DC database audit logging module can be made to\n\t      access LDAP message values that have been freed by a\n\t      preceding database module, resulting in a\n\t      use-after-free. This is only possible when modifying\n\t      certain privileged attributes, such as\n\t      userAccountControl.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2022-32742</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      SMB1 Client with write access to a share can cause\n\t      server memory contents to be written into a file or\n\t      printer.\n\t    </dd>\n\t  </dl>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
