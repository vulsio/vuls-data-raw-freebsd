Jenkins now sends\n\t    Content-Security-Policy headers that enables sandboxing and\n\t    prohibits script execution by default.</p>\n\t  <h5>SECURITY-225 / CVE-2015-7537 (CSRF vulnerability in some administrative actions)</h5>\n\t  <p>Several administration/configuration related URLs could be\n\t    accessed using GET, which allowed attackers to circumvent CSRF\n\t    protection.</p>\n\t  <h5>SECURITY-233 / CVE-2015-7538 (CSRF protection ineffective)</h5>\n\t  <p>Malicious users were able to circumvent CSRF protection on any\n\t    URL by sending specially crafted POST requests.</p>\n\t  <h5>SECURITY-234 / CVE-2015-7539 (Jenkins plugin manager vulnerable to MITM attacks)</h5>\n\t  <p>While the Jenkins update site data is digitally signed, and the\n\t    signature verified by Jenkins, Jenkins did not verify the provided\n\t    SHA-1 checksums for the plugin files referenced in the update site\n\t    data. This enabled MITM attacks on the plugin manager, resulting\n\t    in installation of attacker-provided plugins.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
