We\n\t    have disabled SSLv3 for this combination and set the minimum version\n\t    to be TLSv1.0. We have added this vulnerability to our CVE page and\n\t    are working on filling out the CVE.</p>\n\t  <p>Thanks to Tray Torrance, Marc Chadwick, and David Arena for\n\t    reporting this.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/logstash-forwarder-0-4-0-released\">\n\t  <p>SSLv3 is no longer supported; TLS 1.0+ is required (compatible\n\t    with Logstash 1.4.2+).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
