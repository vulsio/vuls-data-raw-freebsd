The problem is triggered\n\t    by sending the library an HTTP request that uses multipart MIME\n\t    encoding and as an invalid boundary specifier that begins with\n\t    \"-\" instead of \"--\". Once triggered it will\n\t    exhaust all available memory resources effectively creating a DoS\n\t    condition.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
