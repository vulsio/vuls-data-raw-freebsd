There is a segmentation fault, associated with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service in the intuit_diff_type function in pch.c, aka a \"mangled rename\" issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6952\">\n\t  <p>A double free exists in the another_hunk function in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000156\">\n\t  <p>GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code bases have diverged over time.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
