These updates address vulnerabilities\n\t   that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the\n\t   affected system. Adobe recommends users update their product\n\t   installations to the latest versions.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve memory corruption vulnerabilities that could\n\t   lead to code execution (CVE-2015-3078, CVE-2015-3089, CVE-2015-3090,\n\t   CVE-2015-3093).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve a heap overflow vulnerability that could lead\n\t   to code execution (CVE-2015-3088).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race\n\t   condition that could be exploited to bypass Protected Mode in\n\t   Internet Explorer (CVE-2015-3081).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve validation bypass issues that could be\n\t   exploited to write arbitrary data to the file system under user\n\t   permissions (CVE-2015-3082, CVE-2015-3083, CVE-2015-3085).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve an integer overflow vulnerability that could\n\t   lead to code execution (CVE-2015-3087).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve a type confusion vulnerability that could lead\n\t   to code execution (CVE-2015-3077, CVE-2015-3084, CVE-2015-3086).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve a use-after-free vulnerability that could lead\n\t   to code execution (CVE-2015-3080).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve memory leak vulnerabilities that could be used\n\t   to bypass ASLR (CVE-2015-3091, CVE-2015-3092).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   These updates resolve a security bypass vulnerability that could lead\n\t   to information disclosure (CVE-2015-3079), and provide additional\n\t   hardening to protect against CVE-2015-3044.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
