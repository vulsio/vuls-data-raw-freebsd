This can be exploited to\n\t    delete files with the permissions of the web server via directory\n\t    traversal sequences passed within the \"refkey\" parameter.</p>\n\t  <p>NOTE: Users with the \"Advanced\" user level are able to include and\n\t    execute uploaded PHP code via the \"pivot_path\" parameter in\n\t    extensions/bbclone_tools/getkey.php when\n\t    extensions/bbclone_tools/hr_conf.php can be deleted.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
