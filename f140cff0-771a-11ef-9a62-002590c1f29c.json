When\n\tpf is configured to allow ND and block incoming Echo Requests, a\n\tcrafted Echo Request packet after a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) can\n\ttrigger an Echo Reply.  The packet has to come from the same host\n\tas the NS and have a zero as identifier to match the state created\n\tby the Neighbor Discovery and allow replies to be generated.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>ICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall\n\trules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going\n\tto create a state in the state table.</p>\n\t<h1>Note:</h1>\n\t<p>This advisory introduced additional issues that were addressed by\n\tFreeBSD-EN-24:16.pf.  Please refer to that erratum for additional\n\tfixes.</p>\n      "
