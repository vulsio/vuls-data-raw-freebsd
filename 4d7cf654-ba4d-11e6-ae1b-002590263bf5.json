(Their AVX or AVX-512 extensions would consider only\n\t    CR0.TS.) While during normal operation this is ensured by the\n\t    hardware, if a guest modifies instructions while the hypervisor is\n\t    preparing to emulate them, the #NM delivery could be missed.</p>\n\t  <p>Guest code in one task may thus (unintentionally or maliciously)\n\t    read or modify register state belonging to another task in the same\n\t    VM.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious unprivileged guest user may be able to obtain or\n\t    corrupt sensitive information (including cryptographic material) in\n\t    other programs in the same guest.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
