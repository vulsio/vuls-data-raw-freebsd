While FreeBSD may not be\n\tvulnerable to that exact attack, we have identified several\n\tplaces where inadequate DoS protection could allow an\n\tattacker to consume system resources.</p>\n\t<p>It is not necessary that the attacker be able to establish\n\ttwo-way communication to carry out these attacks. These\n\tattacks impact both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>In the worst case, an attacker could send a stream of\n\tcrafted fragments with a low packet rate which would consume\n\ta substantial amount of CPU.</p>\n\t<p>Other attack vectors allow an attacker to send a stream\n\tof crafted fragments which could consume a large amount of\n\tCPU or all available mbuf clusters on the system.</p>\n\t<p>These attacks could temporarily render a system unreachable\n\tthrough network interfaces or temporarily render a system\n\tunresponsive. The effects of the attack should clear within\n\t60 seconds after the attack stops.</p>\n      "
