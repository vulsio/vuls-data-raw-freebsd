Morgan reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.vsecurity.com/resources/advisory/20120324-1/\">\n\t  <p>In December 2011, VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open\n\t    source office products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice,\n\t    and AbiWord) due to unsafe interpretation of XML files with custom\n\t    entity declarations.  Deeper analysis revealed that the\n\t    vulnerability was caused by acceptance of external entities by the\n\t    libraptor library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by\n\t    these office products.</p>\n\t  <p>In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could\n\t    allow for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft\n\t    and a loss of user privacy when opening potentially malicious ODF\n\t    documents.  For other applications which depend on librdf or\n\t    libraptor, potentially serious consequences could result from\n\t    accepting RDF/XML content from untrusted sources, though the impact\n\t    may vary widely depending on the context.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
