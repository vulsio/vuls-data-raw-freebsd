However, in current\n\t    practice some organizations have scenarios which require them to\n\t    accept zone data from sources that are not fully trusted (for\n\t    example: providers of secondary name service). A party who is\n\t    allowed to feed data into a zone (e.g. by AXFR, IXFR, or Dynamic DNS\n\t    updates) can overwhelm the server which is accepting data by\n\t    intentionally or accidentally exhausting that server's memory.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
