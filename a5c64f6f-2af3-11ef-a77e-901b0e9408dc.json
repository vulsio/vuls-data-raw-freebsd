This misalignment could be exploited to\n\t  create an zip file with contents that vary depending on the\n\t  implementation reading the file. The archive/zip package now\n\t  rejects files containing these errors.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://go.dev/issue/67680\">\n\t  <p>net/netip: unexpected behavior from Is methods for\n\t  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses</p>\n\t  <p>The various Is methods (IsPrivate, IsLoopback, etc) did\n\t  not work as expected for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses,\n\t  returning false for addresses which would return true in\n\t  their traditional IPv4 forms.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
