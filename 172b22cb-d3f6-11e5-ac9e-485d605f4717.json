Plugins which\n\t    make security decisions based on the content of network requests can have these\n\t    decisions subverted if a service worker forges responses to those requests. For\n\t    example, a forged crossdomain.xml could allow a malicious site to violate the\n\t    same-origin policy using the Flash plugin.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
