It could occur while receiving\n\t    large packets over the tuntap/macvtap interfaces and when guest's\n\t    virtio-net driver did not support big/mergeable receive buffers.</p>\n\t  <p>An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to disable\n\t    guest's networking by sending a large number of jumbo frames to the\n\t    guest, exhausting all receive buffers and thus leading to a DoS\n\t    situation.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
