Using its HSTS support, curl can be\n\t      instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure\n\t      clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the\n\t      URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be\n\t      ignored by subsequent transfers when done on the same\n\t      command line because the state would not be properly\n\t      carried on.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2023-23915</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      A cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n\t      vulnerability exists in curl &lt; v7.88.0 that could\n\t      cause HSTS functionality to behave incorrectly when\n\t      multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS\n\t      support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of\n\t      using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is\n\t      provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however\n\t      surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in\n\t      parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the\n\t      most recently completed transfer. A later HTTP-only\n\t      transfer to the earlier host name would then *not* get\n\t      upgraded properly to HSTS.\n\t    </dd>\n\t    <dt>CVE-2023-23916</dt>\n\t    <dd>\n\t      An allocation of resources without limits or throttling\n\t      vulnerability exists in curl &lt; v7.88.0 based on the\n\t      \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning\n\t      that a server response can be compressed multiple times\n\t      and potentially with different algorithms. The number of\n\t      acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression\n\t      chain\" was capped, but the cap was implemented on a\n\t      per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a\n\t      virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply\n\t      by using many headers. The use of such a decompression\n\t      chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", making\n\t      curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap\n\t      memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.\n\t    </dd>\n\t  </dl>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
