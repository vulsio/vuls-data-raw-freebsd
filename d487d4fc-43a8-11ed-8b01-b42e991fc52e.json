Older versions of Zydis failed to properly\n\tinitialize the string object within the formatter buffer,\n\tforgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value\n\tto chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions\n\tlike ZyanStringAppend to make incorrect calculations for the\n\tnew target size, resulting in heap memory corruption.\n\t</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
