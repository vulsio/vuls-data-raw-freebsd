This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error\n\t    in the \"main.c\" file where the \"cmd_buf_size\" size of the buffer\n\t    used to handle FTP commands sent by clients is not properly set\n\t    to the size configured via the \"CommandBufferSize\" directive,\n\t    which could be exploited by attackers to compromise a vulnerable\n\t    server via a specially crafted FTP command.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
