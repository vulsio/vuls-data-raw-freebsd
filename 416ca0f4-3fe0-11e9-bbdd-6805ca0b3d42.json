This vulnerability is assigned\n\t    <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9251\">CVE-2015-9251</a>. RT\n\t    does not use this jQuery feature so it is not directly\n\t    vulnerable. jQuery version 1.12 no longer receives official\n\t    updates, however a fix was posted with recommendations for\n\t    applications to patch locally, so RT will follow this\n\t    recommendation and ship with a patched version.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
