    "text": "\n\t<p>The Asterisk project reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories\">\n\t  <p>A remote crash can be triggered by sending a SIP packet\n\t  to Asterisk with a specially crafted CSeq header and a\n\t  Via header with no branch parameter. The issue is that\n\t  the PJSIP RFC 2543 transaction key generation algorithm\n\t  does not allocate a large enough buffer. By overrunning\n\t  the buffer, the memory allocation table becomes corrupted,\n\t  leading to an eventual crash.</p>\n\t  <p>The multi-part body parser in PJSIP contains a logical\n\t  error that can make certain multi-part body parts attempt\n\t  to read memory from outside the allowed boundaries. A\n\t  specially-crafted packet can trigger these invalid reads\n\t  and potentially induce a crash.</p>\n\t  <p>This issues is in PJSIP, and so the issue can be fixed\n\t  without performing an upgrade of Asterisk at all. However,\n\t  we are releasing a new version of Asterisk with the bundled\n\t  PJProject updated to include the fix.</p>\n\t  <p>If you are running Asterisk with chan_sip, this issue\n\t  does not affect you.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
