This can be exploited to execute\n\t    arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context\n\t    of an affected site if a malicious email is viewed.</p>\n\t  <p>Input passed via a vCard is not properly sanitised before being\n\t    used in a call to \"preg_replace()\" with the \"e\" modifier in\n\t    program/include/rcube_vcard.php. This can be exploited to inject and\n\t    execute arbitrary PHP code by e.g. tricking a user into importing a\n\t    malicious vCard file.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
