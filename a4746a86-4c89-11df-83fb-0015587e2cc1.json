This plugin does not\n\t  sanitize the \"content_heading\" parameter correctly and\n\t  is therefore vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack.</p>\n\t<p>The second vulnerability is related to the avatar upload\n\t  functionality. Images containing PHP code can be uploaded\n\t  and executed.</p>\n      "
