An attacker may introduce\n\t characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the\n\t context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to\n\t produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be\n\t used to successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the\n\t Varnish server.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
