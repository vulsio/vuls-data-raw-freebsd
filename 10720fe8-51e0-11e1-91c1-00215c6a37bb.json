Not\n\t    verifying that attributes being passed through AX have been\n\t    signed could allow an attacker to modify users' information.</p>\n\t  <p>This issue affects Drupal 6.x and 7.x.</p>\n\t  <h3>Access bypass in File module</h3>\n\t  <p>CVE: CVE-2012-0827</p>\n\t  <p>When using private files in combination with certain field\n\t    access modules, the File module will allow users to download\n\t    the file even if they do not have access to view the field it\n\t    was attached to.</p>\n\t  <p>This issue affects Drupal 7.x only.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
