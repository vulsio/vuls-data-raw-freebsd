One such example, reported by Maksim\n\t  Shudrak, causes the Kerberos analyzer to dereference a\n\t  null pointer.  CVE-2019-12175 was assigned for this issue.</li>\n\n\t  <li>The Kerberos parser allows for several fields to be left\n\t  uninitialized, but they were not marked with an &amp;optional\n\t  attribute and several usages lacked existence checks.\n\t  Crafted packet data could potentially cause an attempt\n\t  to access such uninitialized fields, generate a runtime\n\t  error/exception, and leak memory.  Existence checks and\n\t  &amp;optional attributes have been added to the relevent\n\t  Kerberos fields.</li>\n\n\t  <li>BinPAC-generated protocol parsers commonly contain fields\n\t  whose length is derived from other packet input, and for\n\t  those that allow for incremental parsing, BinPAC did not\n\t  impose a limit on how large such a field could grow,\n\t  allowing for remotely-controlled packet data to cause\n\t  growth of BinPAC's flowbuffer bounded only by the numeric\n\t  limit of an unsigned 64-bit integer, leading to memory\n\t  exhaustion.  There is now a generalized limit for how\n\t  large flowbuffers are allowed to grow, tunable by setting\n\t  \"BinPAC::flowbuffer_capacity_max\".</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
