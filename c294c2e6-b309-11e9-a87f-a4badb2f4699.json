A malicious\n\tattacker can cause the lists to grow unbounded. This can\n\tcause an expensive list traversal on every packet being\n\tprocessed, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of\n\tservice.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker with the ability to send specially crafted\n\tTCP traffic to a victim system can degrade network performance\n\tand/or consume excessive CPU by exploiting the inefficiency\n\tof traversing the potentially very large RACK linked lists\n\twith relatively small bandwidth cost.</p>\n      "
