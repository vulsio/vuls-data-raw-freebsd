The gem\n\t    allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output\n\t    when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes\n\t    can lead to an XSS attack on target applications.</p>\n\t  <p>This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
