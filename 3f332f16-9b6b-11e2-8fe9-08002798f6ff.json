This update\n\t   fixes a high-exposure security vulnerability in versions 9.0 and\n\t   later. All users of the affected versions are strongly urged to apply\n\t   the update *immediately*.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   A major security issue (for versions 9.x only) fixed in this release,\n\t   [CVE-2013-1899](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1899),\n\t   makes it possible for a connection request containing a database name\n\t   that begins with \"-\" to be crafted that can damage or destroy files\n\t   within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the port the\n\t   PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request. This issue was\n\t   discovered by Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source\n\t   Software Center.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t   Two lesser security fixes are also included in this release:\n\t   [CVE-2013-1900](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1900),\n\t   wherein random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be\n\t   easy for another database user to guess (all versions), and\n\t   [CVE-2013-1901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1901),\n\t   which mistakenly allows an unprivileged user to run commands that\n\t   could interfere with in-progress backups (for versions 9.x only).\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
