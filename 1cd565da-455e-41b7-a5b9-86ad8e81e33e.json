This\n\t    meant that a caller could freely control what file path would be\n\t    unlinked and replaced with a user-owned seatd socket for the duration\n\t    of the session.</p>\n\t  <p>If seatd-launch had the SUID bit set, this could be used by a\n\t    malicious user to remove files with the privileges of the owner of\n\t    seatd-launch, which is likely root, and replace it with a user-owned\n\t    domain socket.</p>\n\t  <p>This does not directly allow retrieving the contents of existing\n\t    files, and the user-owned socket file is at the current time not\n\t    believed to be directly useful for further exploitation.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
