If an attacker can\n\t  cause MPlayer to visit a specially crafted URL, arbitrary code\n\t  execution with the privileges of the user running MPlayer may\n\t  occur.  A `visit' might be caused by social engineering, or a\n\t  malicious web server could use HTTP redirects which MPlayer\n\t  would then process.</p>\n      "
