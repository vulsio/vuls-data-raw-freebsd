Microsoft Vulnerability Research\n\t      extended this attack to browser JavaScript engines and\n\t      demonstrated that code on a malicious web page could\n\t      read data from other web sites (violating the\n\t      same-origin policy) or private data from the browser\n\t      itself.</p>\n\t    <p>Since this new class of attacks involves measuring\n\t      precise time intervals, as a parti al, short-term,\n\t      mitigation we are disabling or reducing the precision of\n\t      several time sources in Firefox. The precision of\n\t      <code>performance.now()</code> has been reduced from 5μs\n\t      to 20μs, and the <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> feature\n\t      has been disabled because it can be used to construct a\n\t      high-resolution timer.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
