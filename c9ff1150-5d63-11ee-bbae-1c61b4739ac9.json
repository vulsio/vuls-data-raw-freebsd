The `auth_start_session`\n\tfunction can return non-zero (1) value on, e.g., PAM error which may result\n\tin session restrictions such as max concurrent sessions per user by PAM\n\t(ex ./etc/security/limits.conf) to be bypassed. Users (administrators) don't\n\tuse restrictions by PAM are not affected. This issue has been addressed in\n\trelease version 0.9.23. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known\n\tworkarounds for this issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
