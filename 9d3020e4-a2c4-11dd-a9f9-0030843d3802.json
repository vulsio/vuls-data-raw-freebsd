By including HTML\n\t    code in a query and at the same time causing it to fail by\n\t    submitting invalid data, an XSS hole can be exploited.</p>\n\t  <p>There is an XSS problem in the task history attached to\n\t    comments, since the application fails to sanitize the\n\t    old_value and new_value database fields for changed task\n\t    summaries.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://secunia.com/advisories/29215\">\n\t  <p>Input passed via the \"item_summary\" parameter to\n\t    \"index.php?do=details\" is not properly sanitised before being\n\t    returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary\n\t    HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of\n\t    an affected site.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
