However, a regression in\n\t    the 3.4.x series made it ignore all groups which are not\n\t    available in both products. As a workaround, you had to move\n\t    the bug to the new product first and then restrict it to the\n\t    desired groups, in two distinct steps, which could make the bug\n\t    temporarily public.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
