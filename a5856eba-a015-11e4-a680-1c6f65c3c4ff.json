In case an error occurs during parsing of the list, a\n\t    situation is created where the uninitialized pointer is passed to polarssl_free().</p>\n\t  <p>This sequence can be triggered when a PolarSSL entity is parsing a certificate. So practically this\n\t    means clients when receiving a certificate from the server or servers in case they are actively\n\t    asking for a client certificate.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
