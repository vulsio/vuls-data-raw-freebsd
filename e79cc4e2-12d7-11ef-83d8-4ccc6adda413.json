Qt itself is not vulnerable\n\t    to remote attack however an application using QStringDecoder either\n\t    directly or indirectly can be vulnerable.</p>\n\t  <p>This requires:</p>\n\t  <ol>\n\t    <li>the attacker be able to tell the application a specific codec to use</li>\n\t    <li>the attacker be able to feed the application data in a specific way to cause the desired modification</li>\n\t    <li>the attacker what in the stack will get modified, which requires knowing the build of the application (and not all builds will be vulnerable)</li>\n\t    <li>the modification do anything in particular that is useful to the attacker, besides maybe crashing the application</li>\n\t  </ol>\n\t  <p>Qt does not automatically use any of those codecs, so this needs the application\n\t    to implement something using QStringDecoder to be vulnerable.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
