This was addressed in plugins/docsis/packet-docsis.c by adding decrements.</p>\n\t  <p>In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1, the RTSP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rtsp.c by correcting the scope of a variable.</p>\n\t  <p>In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1, 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, and 2.0.0 to 2.0.15, the DMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dmp.c by validating a string length.</p>\n\t  <p>In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, the BT ATT dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-btatt.c by considering a case where not all of the BTATT packets have the same encapsulation level.</p>\n\t  <p>In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, the MBIM dissector could crash or exhaust system memory. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mbim.c by changing the memory-allocation approach.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
