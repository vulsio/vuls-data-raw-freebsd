So this should only affect very specific setups,\n\t     but in such configurations all strongSwan versions since 5.0.1 may be affected.</li>\n\t     <li>A denial-of-service vulnerability in the stroke plugin was fixed.\n\t\t When reading a message from the socket the plugin did not check the received length.\n\t\t Unless a group is configured, root privileges are required to access that socket,\n\t\t so in the default configuration this shouldn't be an issue, but all strongSwan versions may be affected.\n\t     </li>\n\t </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
