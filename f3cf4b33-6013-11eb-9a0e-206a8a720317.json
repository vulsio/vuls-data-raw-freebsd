Miller reports:</p>\n       <blockquote cite=\"https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.5p2\">\n\t <p>When invoked as sudoedit, the same set of command line options\n\t    are now accepted as for sudo -e. The -H and -P options are now\n\t    rejected for sudoedit and sudo -e which matches the sudo 1.7\n\t    behavior. This is part of the fix for CVE-2021-3156.</p>\n\t <p>Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes in\n\t    the command's arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special characters\n\t    when running a command via a shell (sudo -s or sudo -i). However,\n\t    it was also possible to run sudoedit with the -s or -i flags in\n\t    which case no escaping had actually been done, making a buffer\n\t    overflow possible. This fixes CVE-2021-3156.</p>\n       </blockquote>\n      "
