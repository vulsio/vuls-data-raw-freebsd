An attacker can request\n\tloading of a PKCS#11 module across forwarded agent-socket.\n\t[CVE-2016-10009]</p>\n\t<p>When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix\n\tdomain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges\n\tof 'root' instead of the authenticated user. [CVE-2016-10010]</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A remote attacker who have control of a forwarded\n\tagent-socket on a remote system and have the ability to\n\twrite files on the system running ssh-agent(1) agent can\n\trun arbitrary code under the same user credential. Because\n\tthe attacker must already have some control on both systems,\n\tit is relatively hard to exploit this vulnerability in a\n\tpractical attack. [CVE-2016-10009]</p>\n\t<p>When privilege separation is disabled (on FreeBSD,\n\tprivilege separation is enabled by default and has to be\n\texplicitly disabled), an authenticated attacker can potentially\n\tgain root privileges on systems running OpenSSH server.\n\t[CVE-2016-10010]</p>\n      "
