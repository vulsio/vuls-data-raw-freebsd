It [was] found\n\t    with help of oss-fuzz Google project by me and short after that\n\t    independently also by Richard Johnson of Trellix Threat Labs.</p>\n\t  <p>It is affected only by DHCPv6 requests, which could be crafted to\n\t    modify already freed memory. [...] We think it might be triggered\n\t    remotely, but we do not think it could be used to execute remote\n\t    code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
