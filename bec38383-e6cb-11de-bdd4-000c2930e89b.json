This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script\n\t    code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP\n\t    requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests.\n\t    This can be exploited to e.g. create an arbitrary user with administrative\n\t    privileges if a logged-in administrative user visits a malicious web\n\t    site.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
