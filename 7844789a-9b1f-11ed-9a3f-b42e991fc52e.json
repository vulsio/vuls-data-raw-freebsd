If the built-in \"/rrdp\"\n\t\tendpoint is exposed directly to the internet, then malicious remote\n\t\tparties can cause the publication server to crash. The repository\n\t\tcontent is not affected by this, but the availability of the server\n\t\tand repository can cause issues if this attack is persistent and is\n\t\tnot mitigated. .\n\t</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
