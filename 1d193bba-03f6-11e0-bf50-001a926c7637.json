Configurations using RC4 for the TGT key are\n\t    believed to be rare.</p>\n\t  <p>An authenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging\n\t    AD-KDC-ISSUED signatures on authdata elements in tickets having\n\t    an RC4 service key, resulting in privilege escalation against\n\t    a service that relies on these signatures.
