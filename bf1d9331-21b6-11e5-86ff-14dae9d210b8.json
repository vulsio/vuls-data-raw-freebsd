An attacker being able\n\t    to submit print jobs could exploit this flaw to crash texttopdf or,\n\t    possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'lp' user.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Tim Waugh reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7365\">\n\t  <p>The Page allocation is moved into textcommon.c, where it does all the\n\t    necessary checking: lower-bounds for CVE-2015-3258 and upper-bounds\n\t    for CVE-2015-3259 due to integer overflows for the calloc() call\n\t    initializing Page[0] and the memset() call in texttopdf.c's\n\t    WritePage() function zeroing the entire array.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
