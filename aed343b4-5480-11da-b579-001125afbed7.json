This value is used as an index in Flash.ocx\n\t    to reference an array of function pointers.  This can be\n\t    exploited via a specially crafted SWF file to cause\n\t    the index to reference memory that is under the attacker's\n\t    control, which causes Flash Player to use attacker\n\t    supplied values as function pointers.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary\n\t    code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
