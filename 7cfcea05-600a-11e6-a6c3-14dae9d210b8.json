[CVE-2016-4957, Reported by\n\tNicolas Edet of Cisco]</p>\n\t<p>An attacker who knows the origin timestamp and can send\n\ta spoofed packet containing a CRYPTO-NAK to an ephemeral\n\tpeer target before any other response is sent can demobilize\n\tthat association. [CVE-2016-4953, Reported by Miroslav\n\tLichvar of Red Hat]</p>\n\t<p>An attacker who is able to spoof packets with correct\n\torigin timestamps from enough servers before the expected\n\tresponse packets arrive at the target machine can affect\n\tsome peer variables and, for example, cause a false leap\n\tindication to be set.
