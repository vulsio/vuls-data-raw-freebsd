This can be\n\t    exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's\n\t    browser session in context of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation requires that \"register_globals\" is enabled\n\t    and support for \".htaccess\" files is disabled.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
