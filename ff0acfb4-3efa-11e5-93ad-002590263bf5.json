During the compilation of a malformed regular expression,\n\t    more data is written on the malloced block than the expected size\n\t    output by compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui\n\t    techniques may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the\n\t    context of the user running the affected application.</p>\n\t  <p>Latest version of PCRE is prone to a Heap Overflow vulnerability\n\t    which could caused by the following regular expression.</p>\n\t  <p>/(?J:(?|(:(?|(?'R')(\\k'R')|((?'R')))H'Rk'Rf)|s(?'R'))))/</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
