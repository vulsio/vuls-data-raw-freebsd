This operation may fail when in parallel the domain gets\n\t    torn down. So far this failure unconditionally resulted in the host\n\t    being brought down due to an internal error being assumed. This is\n\t    CVE-2015-8339.</p>\n\t  <p>Furthermore error handling so far wrongly included the release of a\n\t    lock. That lock, however, was either not acquired or already released\n\t    on all paths leading to the error handling sequence. This is\n\t    CVE-2015-8340.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious guest administrator may be able to deny service by\n\t    crashing the host or causing a deadlock.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
