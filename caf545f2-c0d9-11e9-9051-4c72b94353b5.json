The memory copied is that of the configured push\n\t    link header values, not data supplied by the client.</p>\n\t  <h1>SECURITY: CVE-2019-9517</h1>\n\t  <p>mod_http2: a malicious client could perform a DoS attack by flooding\n\t    a connection with requests and basically never reading responses\n\t    on the TCP connection. Depending on h2 worker dimensioning, it was\n\t    possible to block those with relatively few connections.</p>\n\t  <h1>SECURITY: CVE-2019-10098</h1>\n\t  <p>rewrite, core: Set PCRE_DOTALL flag by default to avoid unpredictable\n\t    matches and substitutions with encoded line break characters.</p>\n\t  <h1>SECURITY: CVE-2019-10092</h1>\n\t  <p>Remove HTML-escaped URLs from canned error responses to prevent misleading\n\t    text/links being displayed via crafted links.</p>\n\t  <h1>SECURITY: CVE-2019-10097</h1>\n\t  <p>mod_remoteip: Fix stack buffer overflow and NULL pointer deference\n\t    when reading the PROXY protocol header.</p>\n\t  <h1>CVE-2019-10082</h1>\n\t  <p>mod_http2: Using fuzzed network input, the http/2 session\n\t    handling could be made to read memory after being freed,\n\t    during connection shutdown.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
