When\n\tthis happens, changes to architectural state are not\n\tcommitted, but observable changes may be left in micro-\n\tarchitectural state (for example, cache). This may be used\n\tto infer privileged data.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre V2) - --------------------------</p>\n\t<p>Spectre V2 uses branch target injection to speculatively\n\texecute kernel code at an address under the control of an\n\tattacker.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker may be able to read secret data from the\n\tkernel or from a process when executing untrusted code (for\n\texample, in a web browser).</p>\n      "
