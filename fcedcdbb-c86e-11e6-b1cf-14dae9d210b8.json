Reported by Matthew Van Gundy\n\tof Cisco ASIG.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7427: Broadcast Mode Replay Prevention DoS.\n\tReported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7428: Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement\n\tDoS. Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7431: Regression: 010-origin: Zero Origin\n\tTimestamp Bypass. Reported by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal\n\tMalhotra of Boston University.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference in\n\t_IO_str_init_static_internal(). Reported by Magnus Stubman.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7426: Client rate limiting and server responses.\n\tReported by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem. Reported\n\tindependently by Brian Utterback of Oracle, and by Sharon\n\tGoldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A remote attacker who can send a specially crafted packet\n\tto cause a NULL pointer dereference that will crash ntpd,\n\tresulting in a Denial of Service. [CVE-2016-9311]</p>\n\t<p>An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability\n\texists in the control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd.\n\tIf, against long-standing BCP recommendations, \"restrict\n\tdefault noquery ...\" is not specified, a specially crafted\n\tcontrol mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing information\n\tdisclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,\n\tdisabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote.\n\t[CVE-2016-9310]</p>\n\t<p>An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can\n\tperiodically inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP\n\tpackets into the broadcast domain which, while being logged\n\tby ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets\n\tfrom legitimate NTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7427]</p>\n\t<p>An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can\n\tsend specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the\n\tbroadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, will\n\tcause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate\n\tNTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7428]</p>\n\t<p>Origin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6.\n\tHowever, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced\n\ta regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp\n\tchecks. [CVE-2016-7431]</p>\n\t<p>If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests\n\tfrom a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd\n\twill crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist\n\tquery packet. [CVE-2016-7434]</p>\n\t<p>An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4\n\trefid in server response) and knows the system is (mis)configured\n\tin this way can periodically send packets with spoofed\n\tsource address to keep the rate limiting activated and\n\tprevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources.\n\t[CVE-2016-7426]</p>\n\t<p>Ntp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay\n\twas included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher\n\tthan expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print\n\tvariable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect,\n\tresulting in a root distance that did not include the peer\n\tdispersion. The calculations and formulas have been reviewed\n\tand reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.\n\t[CVE-2016-7433]</p>\n      "
