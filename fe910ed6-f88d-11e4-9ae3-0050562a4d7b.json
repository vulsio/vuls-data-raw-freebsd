This issue was\n\t   reported by Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team and was fixed\n\t   by Pierre Chifflier of ANSSI.</p>\n\n\t  <p>Those processing large numbers of (untrusted) pcap files need to update\n\t   as a malformed pcap could crash Suricata. Again, credits go to Kostya\n\t   Kortchinsky.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
