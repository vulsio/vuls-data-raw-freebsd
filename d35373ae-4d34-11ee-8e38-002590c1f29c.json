That\n\tis, a packet with multiple fragment extension headers would not be recognized\n\tas the correct ultimate payload. Instead a packet with multiple IPv6 fragment\n\theaders would unexpectedly be interpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than\n\tas whatever the real payload is.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>IPv6 fragments may bypass firewall rules written on the assumption all\n\tfragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed\n\tby the host.</p>\n      "
