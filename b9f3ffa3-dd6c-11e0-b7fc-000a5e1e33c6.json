The vulnerability\n\t    is caused due to an integer overflow error in the \"paf24_init()\"\n\t    function (src/paf.c) when processing Paris Audio (PAF) files.\n\t    This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via\n\t    a specially crafted file.  Successful exploitation may allow\n\t    execution of arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is confirmed in\n\t    version 1.0.24.  Other versions may also be affected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
