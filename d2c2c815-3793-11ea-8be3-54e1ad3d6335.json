Intel is releasing software\n\t    updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>Description: Insufficient control flow in certain data\n\t    structures for some Intel(R) Processors with Intel(R) Processor\n\t    Graphics may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable\n\t    information disclosure via local access.</p>\n\t  <p>This patch provides mitigation for Gen9 hardware only.  Patches\n\t    for Gen7 and Gen7.5 will be provided later.  Note that Gen8 is not\n\t    impacted due to a previously implemented workaround.  The mitigation\n\t    involves using an existing hardware feature to forcibly clear down\n\t    all EU state at each context switch.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
