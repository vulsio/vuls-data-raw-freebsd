Some two instances of OpenSSL::X509::Name are equal only when\n\t    all entities are exactly equal. However, there is a bug that the\n\t    equality check is not correct if the value of an entity of the\n\t    argument (right-hand side) starts with the value of the receiver\n\t    (left-hand side). So, if a malicious X.509 certificate is passed to\n\t    compare with an existing certificate, there is a possibility to be\n\t    judged incorrectly that they are equal.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2018-16396: Tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and\n\t    String#unpack with some directives</p>\n\t  <p>Array#pack method converts the receiver's contents into a string with\n\t    specified format. If the receiver contains some tainted objects, the\n\t    returned string also should be tainted. String#unpack method which\n\t    converts the receiver into an array also should propagate its tainted\n\t    flag to the objects contained in the returned array. But, with B, b, H\n\t    and h directives, the tainted flags are not propagated. So, if a script\n\t    processes unreliable inputs by Array#pack and/or String#unpack with\n\t    these directives and checks the reliability with tainted flags, the\n\t    check might be wrong.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
