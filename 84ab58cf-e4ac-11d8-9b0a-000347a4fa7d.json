Otherwise a lot\n\t    of unauthorized CPU processing can be forced to check\n\t    certificate signatures signed with arbitrary RSA/DSA keys\n\t    chosen by attacker.</p>\n\t  <p>In GnuTLS the signatures are checked from first to last\n\t    certificate, there is no limit on size of keys and no\n\t    limit on length of certificate chain.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
