		"text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description:</h1>\n\t<p>The OpenPAM library searches for policy definitions in\n\tseveral locations. While doing so, the absence of a policy\n\tfile is a soft failure (handled by searching in the next\n\tlocation) while the presence of an invalid file is a hard\n\tfailure (handled by returning an error to the caller).</p>\n\t<p>The policy parser returns the same error code (ENOENT)\n\twhen a syntactically valid policy references a non-existent\n\tmodule as when the requested policy file does not exist.\n\tThe search loop regards this as a soft failure and looks\n\tfor the next similarly-named policy, without discarding the\n\tpartially-loaded configuration.</p>\n\t<p>A similar issue can arise if a policy contains an include\n\tdirective that refers to a non-existent policy.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>If a module is removed, or the name of a module is\n\tmisspelled in the policy file, the PAM library will proceed\n\twith a partially loaded configuration. Depending on the\n\texact circumstances, this may result in a fail-open scenario\n\twhere users are allowed to log in without a password, or\n\twith an incorrect password.</p>\n\t<p>In particular, if a policy references a module installed\n\tby a package or port, and that package or port is being\n\treinstalled or upgraded, there is a brief window of time\n\tduring which the module is absent and policies that use it\n\tmay fail open. This can be especially damaging to Internet-facing\n\tSSH servers, which are regularly subjected to brute-force\n\tscans.</p>\n      "
