If configured with ReuseSession=true, the password is not checked for users with an already existing session. Any user with access to the system D-Bus can therefore unlock any graphical session.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>The default configuration of SDDM on FreeBSD is not affected, since it has ReuseSession=false.</p>\n      "
