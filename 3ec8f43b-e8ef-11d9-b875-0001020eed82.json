    "text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description</h1>\n\t<p>Two problems have been discovered in the FreeBSD TCP stack.</p>\n\t<p>First, when a TCP packets containing a timestamp is\n\t  received, inadequate checking of sequence numbers is\n\t  performed, allowing an attacker to artificially increase the\n\t  internal \"recent\" timestamp for a connection.</p>\n\t<p>Second, a TCP packet with the SYN flag set is accepted for\n\t  established connections, allowing an attacker to overwrite\n\t  certain TCP options.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact</h1>\n\t<p>Using either of the two problems an attacker with knowledge\n\t  of the local and remote IP and port numbers associated with\n\t  a connection can cause a denial of service situation by\n\t  stalling the TCP connection. The stalled TCP connection my\n\t  be closed after some time by the other host.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround</h1>\n\t<p>In some cases it may be possible to defend against these\n\t  attacks by blocking the attack packets using a firewall.\n\t  Packets used to effect either of these attacks would have\n\t  spoofed source IP addresses.</p>\n      "
