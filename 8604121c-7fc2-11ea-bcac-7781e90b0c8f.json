Since the \"attacker client\" does not have\n\t    suitable keys, it can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the other\n\t    session. The time window is small and it can not be used to attack\n\t    a specific client's session, unless some other way is found to make it\n\t    disconnect and reconnect first.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
