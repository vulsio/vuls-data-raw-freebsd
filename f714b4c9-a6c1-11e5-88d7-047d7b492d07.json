Note that the\n\t    virStoragePoolListVolumes API, when used on a storage pool backed by\n\t    a directory in a file system, will only list volumes immediately in\n\t    that directory (there is no traversal into subdirectories). However,\n\t    other APIs such as virStorageVolCreateXML were not checking if a\n\t    potential volume name represented one of the volumes that could be\n\t    returned by virStoragePoolListVolumes; because they were not rejecting\n\t    the use of '/' in a volume name.</p>\n\t  <p>Because no checking was done on volume names, a user could supply\n\t    a potential volume name of something like '../../../etc/passwd' to\n\t    attempt to access a file not belonging to the storage pool. When\n\t    fine-grained Access Control Lists (ACL) are in effect, a user with\n\t    storage_vol:create ACL permission but lacking domain:write permission\n\t    could thus abuse virStorageVolCreateXML and similar APIs to gain\n\t    access to files not normally permitted to that user. Fortunately, it\n\t    appears that the only APIs that could leak information or corrupt\n\t    files require read-write connection to libvirtd; and when ACLs are not\n\t    in use (the default without any further configuration), a user with\n\t    read-write access can already be considered to have full access to the\n\t    machine, and without an escalation of privilege there is no security\n\t    problem.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
