This\n\t  creates an unusual behavior, where <em>user_1</em> can register with one email\n\t  address and <em>user_2</em> can register their username as <em>user_1</em>’s\n\t  email address. As a result, <em>user_1</em> would be prevented from signing\n\t  in to Grafana, since <em>user_1</em> password won’t match with <em>user_2</em>\n\t  email address.</p>\n\t  <p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 moderate\n\t  (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
