Since the EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP\n\tserver) and wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) does not support MODP groups,\n\tthe timing attack described against SAE is not applicable for the\n\tEAP-pwd implementation.</p>\n\t<p>See\n\thttps://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt\n\tfor a detailed description of the bug.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support\n\t(CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled\n\tin the runtime configuration).</p>\n      "
