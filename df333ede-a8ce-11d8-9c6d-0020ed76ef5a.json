    "text": "\n\t<p>Karol Wiesek and Greg MacManus reported via iDEFENSE that the\n\t  Opera web browser contains a flaw in the handling of\n\t  certain URIs.  When presented with these URIs, Opera would\n\t  invoke external commands to process them after some\n\t  validation.  However, if the hostname component of a URI\n\t  begins with a `-', it may be treated as an option by an external\n\t  command.  This could have undesirable side-effects, from\n\t  denial-of-service to code execution.\tThe impact is very\n\t  dependent on local configuration.</p>\n\t<p>After the iDEFENSE advisory was published, the KDE team\n\t  discovered similar problems in KDE's URI handlers.</p>\n      "
