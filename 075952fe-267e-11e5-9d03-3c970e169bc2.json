An error\n\t    in the implementation of this logic can mean that an attacker could\n\t    cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed,\n\t    such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid leaf certificate\n\t    to act as a CA and \"issue\" an invalid certificate.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
