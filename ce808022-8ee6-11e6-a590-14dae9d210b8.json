This issue was partially\n\taddressed in FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch, but some possible\n\tinteger overflows remained.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker who can control the patch file can cause a\n\tcrash or run arbitrary code under the credentials of the\n\tuser who runs bspatch, in many cases, root.</p>\n      "
