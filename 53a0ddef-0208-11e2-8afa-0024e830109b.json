This rarely\n\t     occurred with UDP clients, but could be a significant problem\n\t     for a server handling a steady rate of TCP queries.</p>\n\t  <p>A condition has been corrected where improper handling of\n\t     zero-length RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including\n\t     termination of the named process.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
