Externally exploitable\n\t    vulnerabilities exist only for sites that use the\n\t    rlm_sqlcounter module.  Those sites may be vulnerable to\n\t    SQL injection attacks, similar to the issues noted below.\n\t    All sites that have not deployed the rlm_sqlcounter module\n\t    are not vulnerable to external exploits.</p>\n\t  <p>The issues are:<br/>\n\t    SQL Injection attack in the rlm_sqlcounter module.<br/>\n\t    Buffer overflow in the rlm_sqlcounter module, that may cause\n\t    a server crash. <br/>\n\t    Buffer overflow while expanding %t, that may cause a server\n\t    crash.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
