This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer\n\t    overflow via a specially crafted \"Upack\" executable.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.</p>\n\t  <p>2) A boundary error within the processing of PeSpin packed\n\t    executables in libclamav/spin.c can be exploited to cause a\n\t    heap-based buffer overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.</p>\n\t  <p>3) An unspecified error in the processing of ARJ files can be\n\t    exploited to hang ClamAV.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
