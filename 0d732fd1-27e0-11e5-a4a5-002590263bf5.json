A VNC\n\t    password will not be configured even if one is present in the guest\n\t    configuration.</p>\n\t  <p>qemu-xen-traditional will never start a vnc backend unless\n\t    explicitly configured. However by default it will start an SDL\n\t    backend if it was built with SDL support and $DISPLAY is valid.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
