The people affected were\n\t    primarily located in Iran.  The attacker used a fraudulent SSL\n\t    certificate issued by DigiNotar, a root certificate authority that\n\t    should not issue certificates for Google (and has since revoked\n\t    it). [...]</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>VASCO Data Security International Inc., owner of DigiNotar, issued a\n\t  press statement confirming this incident:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.vasco.com/company/press_room/news_archive/2011/news_diginotar_reports_security_incident.aspx\">\n\t  <p>On July 19th 2011, DigiNotar detected an intrusion\n\t    into its Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure, which resulted\n\t    in the fraudulent issuance of public key certificate requests for\n\t    a number of domains, including Google.com.  [...] an external\n\t    security audit concluded that all fraudulently issued certificates\n\t    were\n\t    revoked.  Recently, it was discovered that at least one fraudulent\n\t    certificate had not been revoked at the time. [...]</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Mozilla, maintainer of the NSS package, from which FreeBSD derived\n\t  ca_root_nss, stated that they:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/09/02/diginotar-removal-follow-up/\">\n\t  <p>revoked our trust in the DigiNotar certificate authority from\n\t    all Mozilla software.  This is not a temporary suspension, it is\n\t    a complete removal from our trusted root program.  Complete\n\t    revocation of trust is a decision we treat with careful\n\t    consideration, and employ as a last resort.\n\t  </p><p>Three central issues informed our decision:</p>\n\t  <ol><li>Failure to notify. [...]</li>\n\t    <li>The scope of the breach remains unknown. [...]</li>\n\t    <li>The attack is not theoretical.</li></ol>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
