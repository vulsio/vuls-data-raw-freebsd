The defect may cause the document to appear\n\t    as corrupted and OpenOffice may crash in a recovery-stuck mode\n\t    requiring manual intervention. A crafted exploitation of the\n\t    defect can allow an attacker to cause denial of service\n\t    (memory corruption and application crash) and possible\n\t    execution of arbitrary code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
