This could allow an attacker to\n\t    easily create many new session records by sending repeated\n\t    requests, potentially filling up the session store or\n\t    causing other users' session records to be evicted.</p>\n\t  <p>The django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware\n\t    has been modified to no longer create empty session records.</p>\n\t  <p>This portion of the fix has been assigned CVE-2015-5963.</p>\n\t  <p>Additionally, on the 1.4 and 1.7 series only, the\n\t    contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush() and\n\t    cache_db.SessionStore.flush() methods have been modified\n\t    to avoid creating a new empty session. Maintainers of\n\t    third-party session backends should check if the same\n\t    vulnerability is present in their backend and correct\n\t    it if so.</p>\n\t  <p>This portion of the fix has been assigned CVE-2015-5964.\n\t    Anyone reporting a similar vulnerability in a third-party\n\t    session backend should not use this CVE ID.</p>\n\t  <p>Thanks Lin Hua Cheng for reporting the issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
