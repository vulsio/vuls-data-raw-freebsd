When a logical device switch happens (e.g. moving\n\t    from a touchpad to a mouse), the server re-calculates the\n\t    information available on the respective master device\n\t    (typically the Virtual Core Pointer). This re-calculation\n\t    only allocated enough memory for a single XKB action\n\t    rather instead of enough for the newly active physical\n\t    device's number of button. As a result, querying or\n\t    changing the XKB button actions results in out-of-bounds\n\t    memory reads and writes.</p>\n\n\t    <p>This may lead to local privilege escalation if the server is run as root or\n\t    remote code execution (e.g. x11 over ssh).</p></li>\n\n\t    <li>CVE-2023-6478/ZDI-CAN-22561: X.Org server:\n\t    Out-of-bounds memory read in RRChangeOutputProperty and\n\t    RRChangeProviderProperty\n\n\t    <p>This fixes an OOB read and the resulting information disclosure.</p>\n\n\t    <p>Length calculation for the request was clipped to a 32-bit integer. With\n\t    the correct stuff-&gt;nUnits value the expected request size was\n\t    truncated, passing the REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE check.</p>\n\n\t    <p>The server then proceeded with reading at least stuff-&gt;nUnits bytes\n\t    (depending on stuff-&gt;format) from the request and stuffing whatever it\n\t    finds into the property. In the process it would also allocate at least\n\t    stuff-&gt;nUnits bytes, i.e. 4GB.</p></li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
