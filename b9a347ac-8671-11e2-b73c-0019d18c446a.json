TYPO3\n\t    sites which have no Extbase extensions installed are not affected.\n\t    Extbase extensions are affected if they use the Query Object Model\n\t    and relation values are user generated input. Credits go to Helmut\n\t    Hummel and Markus Opahle who discovered and reported the issue.</p>\n\t  <p>Access tracking mechanism - Failing to validate user provided\n\t    input, the access tracking mechanism allows redirects to arbitrary\n\t    URLs. To fix this vulnerability, we had to break existing\n\t    behaviour of TYPO3 sites that use the access tracking mechanism\n\t    (jumpurl feature) to transform links to external sites. The link\n\t    generation has been changed to include a hash that is checked\n\t    before redirecting to an external URL. This means that old links\n\t    that have been distributed (e.g. by a newsletter) will not work\n\t    any more.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
