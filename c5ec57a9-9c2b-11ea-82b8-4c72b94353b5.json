Security issues in\n\t    jQuerys DOM manipulation methods, as in .html(), .append(), and the others.\n\t    Security advisories for both of these issues have been published on GitHub.</p>\n\t  <p>Drupal 7 has an Open Redirect vulnerability.\n\t    For example, a user could be tricked into visiting a specially crafted link\n\t    which would redirect them to an arbitrary external URL. The vulnerability is\n\t    caused by insufficient validation of the destination query parameter in the\n\t    drupal_goto() function.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
