However, this does require manual administrator\n\t    actions to take place. Which greatly reduces the impact and\n\t    possible uses.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Squid security advisory 2016:6 reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_6.txt\">\n\t  <p>Due to buffer overflow issues Squid is vulnerable to a denial of\n\t    service attack when processing ESI responses. Due to incorrect input\n\t    validation Squid is vulnerable to public information disclosure of\n\t    the server stack layout when processing ESI responses. Due to\n\t    incorrect input validation and buffer overflow Squid is vulnerable\n\t    to remote code execution when processing ESI responses.</p>\n\t  <p>These problems allow ESI components to be used to perform a denial\n\t    of service attack on the Squid service and all other services on the\n\t    same machine. Under certain build conditions these problems allow\n\t    remote clients to view large sections of the server memory. However,\n\t    the bugs are exploitable only if you have built and configured the\n\t    ESI features to be used by a reverse-proxy and if the ESI components\n\t    being processed by Squid can be controlled by an attacker.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
