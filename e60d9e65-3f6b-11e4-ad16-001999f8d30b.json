While this crash technically\n\t    occurs due to a configuration issue, as attempting to\n\t    receive a fax from a channel driver that only contains\n\t    textual information will never succeed, the likelihood\n\t    of having it occur is sufficiently high as to warrant\n\t    this advisory.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
