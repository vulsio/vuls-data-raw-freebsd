The effective cryptographic strength\n\t    of a key exchange using these parameters was weaker than the one one\n\t    could get by using a prime p. Moreover, since there is no indication of\n\t    how these parameters were chosen, the existence of a trapdoor that makes\n\t    possible for an eavesdropper to recover the shared secret from a key\n\t    exchange that uses them cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
