This causes Asterisk\n\t  to consume more and more memory since the transaction\n\t  will never terminate (even if the call is hung up),\n\t  ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk.\n\t  Outbound authentication must be configured on the endpoint\n\t  for this to occur.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
