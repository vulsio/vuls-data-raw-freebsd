		"text": "\n\t<p>Michael Gmelin and JÃ¶rg Scheinert has reported a remote\n\t  command execution vulnerability in portaudit.</p>\n\t<p>An attacker who can get the user to use a specially crafted\n\t  audit file will be able to run commands on the users system,\n\t  with the privileges of the user running running portaudit\n\t  (often root).</p>\n\t<p>The attack could e.g. happen through DNS hijacking or a man\n\t  in the middle attack.</p>\n\t<p>Note that if the user has set up portaudit to run from\n\t  periodic this attack could happen without direct user\n\t  interaction.</p>\n\t<p>In the FreeBSD Ports Collection (bsd.port.mk) the check for\n\t  vulnerable ports at install-time directly operates on the\n\t  auditfile and has the same vulnerability as portaudit.  As\n\t  the Ports Collection infrastructure does not have a version\n\t  number just be sure to have a Ports Collection new enough to\n\t  contain the fix for portaudit.  Note that this is <em>only</em>\n\t  a problem for users which has portaudit installed, as they will\n\t  not have the audit database installed or downloaded\n\t  otherwise.</p>\n      "
