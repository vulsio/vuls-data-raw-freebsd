The\n\t    FreeRADIUS usage of OpenSSL, in CRL application, limits the checks\n\t    to leaf certificates, therefore not detecting revocation of\n\t    intermediate CA certificates.</p>\n\t  <p>An unexpired client certificate, issued by an intermediate CA with\n\t    a revoked certificate, is therefore accepted by FreeRADIUS.</p>\n\t  <p>Specifically sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag for leaf\n\t    certificate CRL checks, but does not use X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL\n\t    for CRL checks on the complete trust chain.</p>\n\t  <p>The FreeRADIUS project advises that the recommended configuration\n\t    is to use self-signed CAs for all EAP-TLS methods.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
