This vulnerability is assigned\n\t    CVE-2014-1474.</p>\n\t  <p>This vulnerability is caused by poor parsing performance\n\t    in the Email::Address::List module, which RT depends on. We\n\t    recommend that affected users upgrade their version of\n\t    Email::Address::List to v0.02 or above, which resolves the\n\t    issue. Due to a communications mishap, the release on CPAN\n\t    will temporarily appear as \"unauthorized,\" and the\n\t    command-line cpan client will hence not install it. We\n\t    expect this to be resolved shortly; in the meantime, the\n\t    release is also available from our server.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
