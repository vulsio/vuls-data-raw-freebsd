    "text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description:</h1>\n\t<p>The fwctl driver implements a state machine which is executed when\n\tthe guest accesses certain x86 I/O ports.  The interface lets the guest\n\tcopy a string into a buffer resident in the bhyve process' memory.  A\n\tbug in the state machine implementation can result in a buffer\n\toverflowing when copying this string.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit\n\tthe buffer overflow to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve\n\tuserspace process, which typically runs as root.  Note that bhyve runs\n\tin a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the\n\tcapabilities available to the bhyve process.</p>\n      "
