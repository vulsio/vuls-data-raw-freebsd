This includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php\n\t    which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management\n\t    system being used.\n\t    In case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting\n\t    network, this allows to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents.\n\t    This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote\n\t    code execution by injecting custom extensions.</p>\n\t  <p>It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate\n\t    arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic\n\t    message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described\n\t    below.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
