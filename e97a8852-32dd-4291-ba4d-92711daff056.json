Using character entities, it\n\t  was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not\n\t  allowed that would slide through unsanitized.</p>\n\t  <p>This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1. Anyone using\n\t  Bleach 2.1 is highly encouraged to upgrade.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
