This can be exploited by replacing an existing sub\n\t    directory in the directory tree with a symbolic link to an arbitrary\n\t    file.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation may allow changing permissions of arbitrary\n\t    files, if root uses an application using the vulnerable code to delete\n\t    files in a directory having a world-writable sub directory.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
