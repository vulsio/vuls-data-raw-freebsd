This means that a PV guest can\n\t    create writable mappings using super page mappings. Such writable\n\t    mappings can violate Xen intended invariants for pages which Xen is\n\t    supposed to keep read-only. This is possible even if the\n\t    \"allowsuperpage\" command line option is not used.</p>\n\t  <p>Malicious PV guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to\n\t    control the whole system.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
