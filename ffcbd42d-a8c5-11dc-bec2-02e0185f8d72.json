The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within\n\t    the \"send_mailslot()\" function.  This can be exploited to cause a\n\t    stack-based buffer overflow with zero bytes via a specially crafted\n\t    \"SAMLOGON\" domain logon packet containing a username string placed\n\t    at an odd offset followed by an overly long GETDC string.\n\t    Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but\n\t    requires that the \"domain logons\" option is enabled.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
