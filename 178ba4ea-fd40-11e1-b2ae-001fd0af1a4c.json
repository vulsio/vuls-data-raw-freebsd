This could be an issue if\n\t     the HTTP server has access to machines that are not otherwise\n\t     publicly visible.</p>\n\t  <p>The second problem would permit a hostile third party to execute\n\t     JavaScript in users' browsers in context of the domain running\n\t     mod_pagespeed, which could permit interception of users' cookies or\n\t     data on the site.</p>\n\t  <p>Because of the severity of the two problems, users are strongly\n\t     encouraged to update immediately.</p>\n\t  <p>Behavior Changes in the Update:</p>\n\t  <p>As part of the fix to the first issue, mod_pagespeed will not fetch\n\t     resources from machines other than localhost if they are not\n\t     explicitly mentioned in the configuration. This means that if you\n\t     need resources on the server's domain to be handled by some other\n\t     system, you'll need to explicitly use ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain\n\t     or ModPagespeedDomain to authorize that.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
