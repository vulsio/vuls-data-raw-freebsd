Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages\n\tcontaining HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results.\n\tTo exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching\n\tfor a specific message containing an HTML injection payload.  No\n\tcross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content\n\tsecurity policy.  Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue.\n\tAs a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
