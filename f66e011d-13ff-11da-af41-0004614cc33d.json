When the victim with that message in his or her\n\t    inbox starts Elm or simply views the inbox in an already\n\t    started copy of Elm, the buffer overflow will happen\n\t    immediately. The overflow is stack-based, and it gives full\n\t    control over EIP, EBP and EBX. It is caused by a bad\n\t    sscanf(3) call, using a format string containing \"%s\"\n\t    to copy from a long char array to a shorter array.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
