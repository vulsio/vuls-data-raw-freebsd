The vulnerability is caused due to a\n\t  boundary error within the \"ulSetError()\" function\n\t  (src/util/ulError.cxx) when creating the error message,\n\t  which can be exploited to overflow a static buffer.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary\n\t  code but requires that the attacker can e.g. control the\n\t  content of an overly long error message passed to the\n\t  \"ulSetError()\" function.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.8.5. Other\n\t  versions may also be affected.</p>\n\t  <p>Originally reported in TORCS by Andres Gomez.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
