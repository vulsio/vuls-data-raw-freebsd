Due to improper handling of elements under the\n\t`contentEditable` element, maliciously crafted clipboard content\n\tcan inject arbitrary HTML tags into the DOM.  A low-privileged\n\tattacker with permission to attach a document on a vulnerable\n\tKanboard instance can trick the victim into pasting malicious\n\tscreenshot data and achieve cross-site scripting if CSP is improperly\n\tconfigured.  This issue has been patched in version 1.2.29.\n\t</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
