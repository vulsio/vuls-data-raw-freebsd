This denial-of-service may\n\t    encompass both CPU and disk usage, depending on RT's logging\n\t    configuration. This vulnerability is assigned\n\t    CVE-2014-9472.</p>\n\t  <p>RT 3.8.8 and above are vulnerable to an information\n\t    disclosure attack which may reveal RSS feeds URLs, and thus\n\t    ticket data; this vulnerability is assigned\n\t    CVE-2015-1165. RSS feed URLs can also be leveraged to\n\t    perform session hijacking, allowing a user with the URL to\n\t    log in as the user that created the feed; this vulnerability\n\t    is assigned CVE-2015-1464.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
