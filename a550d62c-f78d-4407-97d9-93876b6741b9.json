The latter has a\n\t  possibility of a remote heap-buffer-overread, making this\n\t  a potential DoS vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p> Add some extra length checking when parsing mobile\n\t  ipv6 packets. Due to the possibility of reading invalid\n\t  headers from remote sources, this is a potential DoS\n\t  vulnerability. </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
