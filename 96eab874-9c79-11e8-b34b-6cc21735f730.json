In particular, the state variable that determined whether\n\t  or not a password is needed for a connection would not be reset, which\n\t  could allow users of features requiring libpq, such as the \"dblink\" or\n\t  \"postgres_fdw\" extensions, to login to servers they should not be able\n\t  to access.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2018-10925: Memory disclosure and missing authorization in\n\t  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`</p>\n\t  <p>An attacker able to issue CREATE TABLE can read arbitrary bytes of\n\t  server memory using an upsert (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`)\n\t  query.  By default, any user can exploit that. A user that has\n\t  specific INSERT privileges and an UPDATE privilege on at least one\n\t  column in a given table can also update other columns using a view and\n\t  an upsert query.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
