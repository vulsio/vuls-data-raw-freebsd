		"text": "\n\t <p>The mysql_real_connect function doesn't properly handle DNS replies\n\t   by copying the IP address into a buffer without any length checking.\n\t   A specially crafted DNS reply may therefore be used to cause a buffer\n\t   overflow on affected systems.</p>\n\t <p>Note that whether this issue can be exploitable depends on the\n\t   system library responsible for the gethostbyname function. The bug\n\t   finder, Lukasz Wojtow, explaines this with the following words:</p>\n\t <blockquote cite=\"http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4017\">\n\t   <p>In glibc there is a limitation for an IP address to have only 4\n\t     bytes (obviously), but generally speaking the length of the address\n\t     comes with a response for dns query (i know it sounds funny but\n\t     read rfc1035 if you don't believe). This bug can occur on libraries\n\t     where gethostbyname function takes length from dns's response</p>\n\t </blockquote>\n       "
