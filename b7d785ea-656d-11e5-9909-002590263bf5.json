Latin-1, UTF-8, and other \"low ASCII\"\n\t    character sets are unaffected on all environments.</p>\n\t  <p>If you are running or considering running a multi-byte character\n\t    set for your database connection, please pay close attention to the\n\t    server environment you are deploying on to ensure you are not\n\t    vulnerable.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
