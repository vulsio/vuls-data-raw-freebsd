    "text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description:</h1>\n\t<p>pam_krb5 authenticates the user by essentially running kinit(1) with\n\tthe password, getting a `ticket-granting ticket' (tgt) from the Kerberos\n\tKDC (Key Distribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the\n\tpassword.</p>\n\t<p>Normally, the system running the pam_krb5 module will also have a\n\tkeytab, a key provisioned by the KDC. The pam_krb5 module will use the\n\ttgt to get a service ticket and validate it against the keytab, ensuring\n\tthe tgt is valid and therefore, the password is valid.</p>\n\t<p>However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has\n\tno way to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the\n\ttgt provided over the network as being valid.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>In a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5 for\n\tauthentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that\n\tis able to control both the password and the KDC responses can return a\n\tvalid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on the\n\tsystem.</p>\n      "
