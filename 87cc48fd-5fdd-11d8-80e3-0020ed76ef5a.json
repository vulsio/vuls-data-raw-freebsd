And\n\t    when the content has to be sent to the client,\n\t    UdmDocToTextBuf() concatenates those parts together and\n\t    skips metadata.</p>\n\t  <p>Unfortunately, that function lacks bounds checking and\n\t    a buffer overflow can be triggered by indexing a large\n\t    enough document.</p>\n\t  <p>'len' is fixed to 10K [in UdmDocToTextBuf] in searchd.c\n\t    . S-&gt;val length depends on the length of the original\n\t    document and on the indexer settings (the sample\n\t    configuration file has low limits that work around the\n\t    bug, though).</p>\n\t  <p>Exploitation should be easy, moreover textbuf points to\n\t  the stack.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
