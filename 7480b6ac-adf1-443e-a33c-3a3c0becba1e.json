This attack can be\n\t    only mounted by users with some trust, but it results in arbitrary\n\t    code execution on the master.</p>\n\t  <p>SECURITY-162 is rated <strong>critical</strong>. This attack can be\n\t    only mounted by users with some trust, but it results in the\n\t    exposure of sensitive information.</p>\n\t  <p>SECURITY-163 is rated <strong>medium</strong>, as it results in the\n\t    loss of functionality.</p>\n\t  <p>SECURITY-165 is rated <strong>critical</strong>. This attack is\n\t    easy to mount, and it results in the exposure of sensitive\n\t    information.</p>\n\t  <p>SECURITY-166 is rated <strong>critical</strong>. For users who use\n\t    the affected feature, this attack results in arbitrary code\n\t    execution on the master.</p>\n\t  <p>SECURITY-167 is rated <strong>critical</strong>. This attack is\n\t    easy to mount, and it results in the exposure of sensitive information.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
