		"text": "\n\t<p>Stefan Esser of e-matters discovered a condition within PHP\n\t  that may lead to remote execution of arbitrary code.\tThe\n\t  memory_limit facility is used to notify functions when memory\n\t  contraints have been met. Under certain conditions, the entry\n\t  into this facility is able to interrupt functions such as\n\t  zend_hash_init() at locations not suitable for interruption.\n\t  The result would leave these functions in a vulnerable state.</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/112004.html\">\n\t  <p>An attacker that is able to trigger the memory_limit abort\n\t    within zend_hash_init() and is additionally able to control\n\t    the heap before the HashTable itself is allocated, is able to\n\t    supply his own HashTable destructor pointer. [...]</p>\n\t  <p>All mentioned places outside of the extensions are quite easy\n\t    to exploit, because the memory allocation up to those places\n\t    is deterministic and quite static throughout different PHP\n\t    versions. [...]</p>\n\t  <p>Because the exploit itself consist of supplying an arbitrary\n\t    destructor pointer this bug is exploitable on any platform.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
