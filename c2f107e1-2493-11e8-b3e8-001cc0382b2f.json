This can be triggered remotely\n\t      from either side in both TLS and DTLS.</li>\n\t    <li>When RSASSA-PSS signature verification is enabled, sending a\n\t      maliciously constructed certificate chain can be used to cause a\n\t      buffer overflow on the peer's stack, potentially leading to crash\n\t      or remote code execution. This can be triggered remotely from\n\t      either side in both TLS and DTLS.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
