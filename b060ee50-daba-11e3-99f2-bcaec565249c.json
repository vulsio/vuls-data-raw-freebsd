This code is commonly\n\t    called from the X server when an X Font Server is active in the\n\t    font path, so may be running in a setuid-root process depending\n\t    on the X server in use.  Exploits of this path could be used by\n\t    a local, authenticated user to attempt to raise privileges; or\n\t    by a remote attacker who can control the font server to attempt\n\t    to execute code with the privileges of the X server.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
