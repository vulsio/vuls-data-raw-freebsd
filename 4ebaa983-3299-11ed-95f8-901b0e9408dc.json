This could potentially allow\n\t  a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this\n\t  endpoint.</p>\n\t  <p>Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints\n\t  (e.g. /event, /state) as they have been correctly verified.</p>\n\t  <p>Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
