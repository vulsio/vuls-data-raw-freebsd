The default config, as shipped by the Exim developers, does not contain ${sort }.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The vulnerability is exploitable either remotely or locally and could\nbe used to execute other programs with root privilege.  The ${sort }\nexpansion re-evaluates its items.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Exim 4.92.1 is not vulnerable.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
