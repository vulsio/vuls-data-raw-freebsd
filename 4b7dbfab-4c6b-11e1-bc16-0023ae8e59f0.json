In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy\n\t    flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse\n\t    proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing\n\t    sensitive information from internal web servers not directly\n\t    accessible to attacker.</p>\n\t  <p>Integer overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in\n\t    the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through\n\t    2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local\n\t    users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted\n\t    SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request\n\t    header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>An additional exposure was found when using mod_proxy in\n\t    reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule\n\t    with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause\n\t    the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly\n\t    disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers\n\t    not directly accessible to attacker.</p>\n\t  <p>A flaw was found in mod_log_config. If the '%{cookiename}C' log\n\t    format string is in use, a remote attacker could send a specific\n\t    cookie causing a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of\n\t    service if using a threaded MPM.</p>\n\t  <p>A flaw was found in the handling of the scoreboard.  An\n\t    unprivileged child process could cause the parent process to\n\t    crash at shutdown rather than terminate cleanly.</p>\n\t  <p>A flaw was found in the default error response for status code\n\t    400.  This flaw could be used by an attacker to expose\n\t    \"httpOnly\" cookies when no custom ErrorDocument is specified.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
