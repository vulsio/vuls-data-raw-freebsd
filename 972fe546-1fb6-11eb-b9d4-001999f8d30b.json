This\n\t  caused a gap between the creation of the dialog object,\n\t  and its next use by the thread that created it. Depending\n\t  upon some off nominal circumstances, and timing it was\n\t  possible for another thread to free said dialog in this\n\t  gap. Asterisk could then crash when the dialog object,\n\t  or any of its dependent objects were de-referenced, or\n\t  accessed next by the initial creation thread.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
