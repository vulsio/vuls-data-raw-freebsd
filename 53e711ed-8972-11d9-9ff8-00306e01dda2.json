This release addresses two\n\t    recent security exploits, one of them critical. They were\n\t    reported a few days after .12 was released and no one is\n\t    more annoyed than us, having to release a new version ini\n\t    such a short period of time. Fortunately both fixes are\n\t    easy and in each case just one line needs to be edited.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
