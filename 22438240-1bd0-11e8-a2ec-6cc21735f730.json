As with the previous issue, this flaw allows for\n\t    changes to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but\n\t    can alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP\n\t    and result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n\t    information.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    As before, the use of XML Encryption is a significant mitigation,\n\t    but we have not dismissed the possibility that attacks on the\n\t    Response \"envelope\" may be possible, in both the original and this\n\t    new case. No actual attacks of this nature are known, so deployers\n\t    should prioritize patching systems that expect to handle unencrypted\n\t    SAML assertions.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    An updated version of XMLTooling-C (V1.6.4) is available that\n\t    protects against these new attacks, and should help prevent similar\n\t    vulnerabilities in the future.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Unlike the previous case, these bugs are NOT prevented by any\n\t    existing Xerces-C parser version on any platform and cannot be\n\t    addressed by any means other than the updated XMLTooling-C library.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The Service Provider software relies on a generic XML parser to\n\t    process SAML responses and there are limitations in older versions\n\t    of the parser that make it impossible to fully disable Document Type\n\t    Definition (DTD) processing.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Through addition/manipulation of a DTD, it's possible to make\n\t    changes to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but\n\t    are mishandled by the SP and its libraries. These manipulations can\n\t    alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and\n\t    result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n\t    information.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the\n\t    SP into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable,\n\t    this feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version\n\t    3.1.4, so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD\n\t    exploit has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the\n\t    ports tree already on 2016-07-26.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n     "
