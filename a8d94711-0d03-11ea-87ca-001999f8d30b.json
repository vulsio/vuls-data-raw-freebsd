A REGISTER does not need to occur,\n\t  and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing\n\t  that needs to be known is the peers name; authentication\n\t  details such as passwords do not need to be known. This\n\t  vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is\n\t  set to the default, or auto_force_rport.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
