The e_hostname function (commands.c) uses tmpnam to\n\t    create a temporary file which is known to be insecure.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Chris reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://secunia.com/advisories/27556\">\n\t  <p>Chris has reported a vulnerability in the Cypress script for\n\t    BitchX, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose\n\t    potentially sensitive information or to compromise a vulnerable\n\t    system.</p>\n\n\t  <p>The vulnerability is caused due to malicious code being present\n\t    in the modules/mdop.m file.  This can be exploited to disclose the\n\t    content of various system files or to execute arbitrary shell\n\t    commands.</p>\n\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but\n\t    requires the control of the \"lsyn.webhop.net\" domain.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
