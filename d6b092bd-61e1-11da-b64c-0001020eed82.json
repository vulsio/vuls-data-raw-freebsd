    "text": "\n\t<p>Opera reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.opera.com/support/search/supsearch.dml?index=819\">\n\t  <p>It is possible to make a form input that looks like an\n\t    image link. If the form input has a \"title\" attribute, the\n\t    status bar will show the \"title\". A \"title\" which looks\n\t    like a URL can mislead the user, since the title can say\n\t    http://nice.familiar.com/, while the form action can be\n\t    something else.</p>\n\t  <p>Opera's tooltip says \"Title:\" before the title text,\n\t    making a spoof URL less convincing. A user who has enabled\n\t    the status bar and disabled tooltips can be affected by\n\t    this. Neither of these settings are Opera's defaults.</p>\n\t  <p>This exploit is mostly of interest to users who disable\n\t    JavaScript. If JavaScript is enabled, any link target or\n\t    form action can be overridden by the script. The tooltip\n\t    and the statusbar can only be trusted to show the true\n\t    location if JavaScript is disabled.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.opera.com/support/search/supsearch.dml?index=817\">\n\t  <p>Java code using LiveConnect methods to remove a property\n\t    of a JavaScript object may in some cases use null pointers\n\t    that can make Opera crash. This crash is not exploitable\n\t    and such code is rare on the web.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
