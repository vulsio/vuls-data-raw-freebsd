Several critical bounds checks were missing,\n\t    resulting in the possibility of heap overflows, should the\n\t    remote server not adhere to these assumptions. In the MMS\n\t    case, a remote server could present content with too many\n\t    individual streams; in the RTSP case, a remote server's\n\t    reply could have too many lines.</p>\n\t  <p>An attacker can set up a server delivering malicious data\n\t    to the users. This can be used to overflow a heap buffer,\n\t    which can, with certain implementations of heap\n\t    management, lead to attacker chosen data written to the\n\t    stack. This can cause attacker-chosen code being executed\n\t    with the permissions of the user running the\n\t    application. By tricking users to retrieve a stream, which\n\t    can be as easy as providing a link on a website, this\n\t    vulnerability can be exploited remotely.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
