A remote\n\t    attacker may be able to gain access to files which exist\n\t    outside of the share's defined path. Such files must still\n\t    be readable by the account used for the connection.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.samba.org/samba/news/#errata_05oct\">\n\t  <p>The original notice for CAN-2004-0815 indicated that\n\t    Samba 3.0.x &lt;= 3.0.5 was vulnerable to the security\n\t    issue. After further research, Samba developers have\n\t    confirmed that only Samba 3.0.2a and earlier releases\n\t    contain the exploitable code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
