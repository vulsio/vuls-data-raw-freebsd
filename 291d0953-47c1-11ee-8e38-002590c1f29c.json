These shared libraries may have\n\tside effects that occur on load and unload (dlopen and dlclose).</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker with access to a server that accepts a forwarded\n\tssh-agent connection may be able to execute code on the machine running\n\tssh-agent.  Note that the attack relies on properties of operating\n\tsystem-provided libraries.  This has been demonstrated on other\n\toperating systems; it is unknown whether this attack is possible using\n\tthe libraries provided by a FreeBSD installation.</p>\n      "
