This can be exploited to spoof the file extension\n\t    in the file download dialog via a specially crafted\n\t    \"Content-Disposition\" HTTP header.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation may result in users being tricked\n\t    into executing a malicious file via the download dialog,\n\t    but requires that the \"Arial Unicode MS\" font\n\t    (ARIALUNI.TTF) has been installed on the system.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
