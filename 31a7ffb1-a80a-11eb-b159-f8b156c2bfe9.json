For example, it was used as following:</p>\n\t<ul><li>To be used as a salt to encrypt passwords stored in the database by\n\tthe RC4 symmetric key algorithm.\n\t<p>Note that RC4 is no longer considered secure enough and is not supported\n\tin the current version of Sympa.</p></li>\n\t<li>To prevent attackers from sending crafted messages to achieve XSS and\n\tso on in message archives.</li></ul>\n\t<p>There were the following problems with the use of this parameter.</p>\n\t<ol><li>This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each\n\tinstallation, and once set, it cannot be changed. As a result, some sites\n\thave been operating without setting this parameter. This completely\n\tinvalidates the security measures described above.</li>\n\t<li>Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not being\n\tstrong enough against brute force attacks.</li></ol>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
