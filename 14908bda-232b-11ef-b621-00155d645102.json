The allocated memory is released when the whole command has been received and processed.</p>\n\t  <p>The IMAP protocol has a number commands that specify an unlimited number of arguments, for example SEARCH. Each of these arguments can be a LITERAL, for which memory will be allocated and not released until the entire command has been received and processed. This can run a server out of memory, with varying consequences depending on the server's OOM policy.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
