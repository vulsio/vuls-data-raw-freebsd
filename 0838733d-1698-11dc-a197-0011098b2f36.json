This\n\t    can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary\n\t    SQL code.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation allows e.g. retrieving usernames and\n\t    password hashes, but requires valid user credentials and knowledge\n\t    of the database table prefix.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
