When doing so, libcurl\n\t    can wrongly send data up to 64K in size to the callback\n\t    which thus is much larger than the documented maximum\n\t    size.</p>\n\t  <p>An application that blindly trusts libcurl's max limit\n\t    for a fixed buffer size or similar is then a possible\n\t    target for a buffer overflow vulnerability.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
