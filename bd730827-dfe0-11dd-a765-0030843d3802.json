Failed attacks will\n\t    cause denial-of-service conditions.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12770/discuss\">\n\t  <p>A buffer-overflow in Grip occurs when the software processes a\n\t    response to a CDDB query that has more than 16 matches.</p>\n\t  <p>To exploit this issue, an attacker must be able to influence the\n\t    response to a CDDB query, either by controlling a malicious CDDB\n\t    server or through some other means. Successful exploits will allow\n\t    arbitrary code to run.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
