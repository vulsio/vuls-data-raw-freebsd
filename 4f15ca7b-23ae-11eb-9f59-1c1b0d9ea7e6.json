These hyperlinks can be triggered unconditionally. In fixed versions no internal protocol may be called from the document event handler and other hyperlinks require a control-click.</p>\n\t  <h2>Severity: Low</h2>\n\t  <p>There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.<br/>A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.</p>\n\t  <p>Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue.</p>\n\t  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n\t  <p>The Apache OpenOffice Security Team would like to thank Imre Rad for discovering and reporting this attack vector.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
