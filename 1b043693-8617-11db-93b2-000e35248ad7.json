The\n\t  first vulnerability is caused by improper checking of the\n\t  src/input/libreal/real.c \"real_parse_sdp()\" function.\n\t  A remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user to\n\t  connect to a preparated server potentially causing a buffer\n\t  overflow.  Another buffer overflow had been found in the\n\t  libmms library, potentially allowing a remote attacker to\n\t  cause a denial of service vulnerability, and possible remote\n\t  code execution through the following functions: send_command,\n\t  string_utf16, get_data and get_media_packets.  Other functions\n\t  might be affected as well.</p>\n      "
