This\n\t    allowed for information disclosure.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Also, impact assessment was redone shortly after the original\n\t  announcement:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20110512.102909.8136175a.en.html\">\n\t  <p>Further analysis revealed that the second security was\n\t    more severe than I realised at the time that I wrote the\n\t    announcement.  The second security issue has been assigned\n\t    CVE-2011-1407 and is also a remote code execution flaw.\n\t    For clarity: both issues were introduced with 4.70.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
