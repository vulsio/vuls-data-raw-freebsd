This can be exploited to trigger the\n\t    use of uninitialized memory in e.g. a free() call via unknown PNG\n\t    chunks having a length of zero.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but\n\t    requires that the application calls the png_set_read_user_chunk_fn()\n\t    function or the png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() function under\n\t    specific conditions.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
