This introduced\n\t    a locally exploitable race condition for those who run \"make\n\t    distcheck\" with a non-restrictive umask (e.g., 022) in a directory\n\t    that was accessible by others.  A successful exploit would result\n\t    in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\n\t    running \"make distcheck\".</p>\n\t  <p>It is important to stress that this vulnerability impacts not only\n\t    the Automake package itself, but all packages with\n\t    Automake-generated makefiles.  For an effective fix it is necessary\n\t    to regenerate the Makefile.in files with a fixed Automake\n\t    version.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
