When parsing the TIFF directory entries\n\t    for certain tags, the parser uses untrusted values from the\n\t    file to calculate the amount of memory to allocate.  By\n\t    providing specially crafted values, an integer overflow occurs\n\t    in this calculation.  This results in the allocation of a\n\t    buffer of insufficient size, which in turn leads to a heap\n\t    overflow.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
