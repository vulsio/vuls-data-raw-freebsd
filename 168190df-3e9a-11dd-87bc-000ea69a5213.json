In this\n\t    situation, fetchmail would resize the buffer and fill in further\n\t    parts of the message, but forget to reinitialize its va_list\n\t    typed source pointer, thus reading data from a garbage address found\n\t    on the stack at addresses above the function arguments the caller\n\t    passed in; usually that would be the caller's stack frame.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
