If a Ruby project\n\t    has a file whose name starts with | and ends with tags, the command\n\t    following the pipe character is executed. A malicious Ruby project\n\t    could exploit it to run an arbitrary command execution against a user\n\t    who attempts to run rdoc command.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
