Eg.  first.example.org and\n\tsecond.example.com.  In affected versions a session cookie\n\tgenerated for the first site can be reused on the second site\n\twithout requiring additional authentication.  This\n\tvulnerability has been addressed in versions 8.7.55, 9.5.44,\n\t10.4.41, 11.5.33, and 12.4.8.  Users are advised to upgrade.\n\tThere are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</p>\n\t<p>Information Disclosure in Install Tool in typo3/cms-install:\n\tIn affected versions the login screen of the standalone\n\tinstall tool discloses the full path of the transient data\n\tdirectory (e.g.  /var/www/html/var/transient/).  This applies\n\tto composer-based scenarios only - classic non-composer\n\tinstallations are not affected.  This issue has been addressed\n\tin version 12.4.8.  Users are advised to upgrade.  There are\n\tno known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer:\n\tIn affected versions DOM processing instructions are not\n\thandled correctly.  This allows bypassing the cross-site\n\tscripting mechanism of typo3/html-sanitizer.  This\n\tvulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.5.3 and 2.1.4.\n\tUsers are advised to upgrade.  There are no known workarounds\n\tfor this vulnerability.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
