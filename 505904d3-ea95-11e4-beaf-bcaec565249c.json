This is a critical security\n\t    release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you\n\t    to update your sites immediately.</p>\n\t  <p>WordPress versions 4.1.1 and earlier are affected by a critical\n\t    cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could enable anonymous\n\t    users to compromise a site. This was reported by Cedric Van\n\t    Bockhaven and fixed by Gary Pendergast, Mike Adams, and Andrew\n\t    Nacin of the WordPress security team.</p>\n\t  <p>We also fixed three other security issues:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>In WordPress 4.1 and higher, files with invalid or unsafe\n\t      names could be uploaded. Discovered by Michael Kapfer and\n\t      Sebastian Kraemer of HSASec.</li>\n\t    <li>In WordPress 3.9 and higher, a very limited cross-site\n\t      scripting vulnerability could be used as part of a social\n\t      engineering attack. Discovered by Jakub Zoczek.</li>\n\t    <li>Some plugins were vulnerable to an SQL injection\n\t      vulnerability. Discovered by Ben Bidner of the WordPress\n\t      security team.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t  <p>We also made four hardening changes, discovered by J.D. Grimes,\n\t    Divyesh Prajapati, Allan Collins, Marc-Alexandre Montpas and\n\t    Jeff Bowen.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
