If file system\n\t  permissions allow it, this may allow the attacker to overwrite\n\t  important system file (if gtar is being run as root), or\n\t  important user configuration files such as .tcshrc or .bashrc,\n\t  which would allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround:</h1>\n\t<p>Use \"bsdtar\", which is the default tar implementation in\n\t  FreeBSD 5.3 and higher.  For FreeBSD 4.x, bsdtar is available\n\t  in the FreeBSD Ports Collection as\n\t  ports/archivers/libarchive.</p>\n      "
