Implications include an assertion failure,\n\t    which could be used for denial-of-service, when verifying signatures\n\t    on the secp_224r1 and secp521_r1 curves.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Even when no assert is triggered in ecdsa_verify, ECC point\n\t    multiplication may get invalid intermediate values as input, and\n\t    produce incorrect results. [...] It appears difficult to construct\n\t    an alleged signature that makes the function misbehave in such a way\n\t    that an invalid signature is accepted as valid, but such attacks\n\t    can't be ruled out without further analysis.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
