Any website can simply create a dns name that they\n\t    are authorized to communicate with, and then make it resolve to\n\t    localhost.</p>\n\t  <p>Exploitation is simple, you could set script-torrent-done-enabled\n\t    and run any command, or set download-dir to /home/user/ and then\n\t    upload a torrent for .bashrc.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
