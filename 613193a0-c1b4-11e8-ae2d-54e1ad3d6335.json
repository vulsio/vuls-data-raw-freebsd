This can cause carefully crafted emails that\n\t    might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of\n\t    Service.</p>\n\t  <p>Fix a reliance on \".\" in @INC in one configuration script.  Whether\n\t    this can be exploited in any way is uncertain.</p>\n\t  <p>Fix a potential Remote Code Execution bug with the PDFInfo plugin.\n\t    Thanks to cPanel Security Team for their report of this issue.</p>\n\t  <p> Fourth, this release fixes a local user code injection in the\n\t    meta rule syntax. Thanks again to cPanel Security Team for their\n\t    report of this issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
