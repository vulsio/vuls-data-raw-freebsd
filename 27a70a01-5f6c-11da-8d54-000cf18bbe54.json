This issue is likely due\n\t    to a design error that causes the application to fail\n\t    to verify the existence of a file before writing to it.</p>\n\n\t  <p>An attacker may leverage this issue to overwrite\n\t    arbitrary files with the privileges of an unsuspecting\n\t    user that activates the vulnerable application.\n\t    Reportedly this issue is unlikely to facilitate\n\t    privilege escalation.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
