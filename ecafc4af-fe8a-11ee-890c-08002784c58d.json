The\n\t    vulnerability is due to an issue in the C to Rust foreign\n\t    function interface. An attacker could exploit this\n\t    vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML\n\t    content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An\n\t    exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV\n\t    scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS\n\t    condition on the affected software.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
