If an event\n      without the \"origin\" field is sent into a federated room, servers not already joined to\n      the room will be unable to do so due to failing to fetch the malformed event.</p>\n    <h1>Impact:</h1>\n      <p>An attacker could cause a denial of service by deliberately sending a malformed event\n      into a room, thus preventing new servers (and thus their users) from joining the\n      room.</p>\n      "
