Previously this event was only produced\n\t    by sqlite3.connect() calls. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.</p>\n\t  <p>bpo-43882: The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL\n\t    could allow some forms of attacks.Following the controlling specification\n\t    for URLs defined by WHATWG urllib.parse() now removes A SCII newlines\n\t    and tabs from URLs, preventing such attacks.</p>\n\t  <p>bpo-43472: Ensures interpreter-level audit hooks receive the cpython.\n\t    PyInterpreterState_New event when called through the _xxsubinterpreters\n\t    module.</p>\n\t  <p>bpo-36384: ipaddress module no longer accepts any leading zeros in IPv4\n\t    address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and interpreted as octal\n\t    notation by some libraries. For example the legacy function socket.inet_aton()\n\t    treats leading zeros as octal notatation. glibc implementation of modern\n\t    inet_pton() does not accept any leading zeros. For a while the ipaddress\n\t    module used to accept ambiguous leading zeros.</p>\n\t  <p>bpo-43075: Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n\t    in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler. The ReDoS-vulnerable regex has\n\t    quadratic worst-case complexity and it allows cause a denial of service\n\t    when identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the client\n\t    side and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.</p>\n\t  <p>bpo-42800: Audit hooks are now fired for frame.f_code, traceback.tb_frame,\n\t    and generator code/frame attribute access.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
