Some of these are critical and allow remote code\n\t\texecution. For the average user, that means that these vulnerabilities can be\n\t\texploited by a malicious attacker in order to take over any Teamspeak server,\n\t\tnot only becoming serveradmin, but getting a shell on the affected machine.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
