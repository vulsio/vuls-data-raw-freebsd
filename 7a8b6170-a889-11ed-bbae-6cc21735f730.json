When a libpq client application\n\t    has a Kerberos credential cache and doesn't explicitly\n\t    disable option gssencmode, a server can cause libpq to\n\t    over-read and report an error message containing\n\t    uninitialized bytes from and following its receive\n\t    buffer. If libpq's caller somehow makes that message\n\t    accessible to the attacker, this achieves a disclosure\n\t    of the over-read bytes. We have not confirmed or ruled\n\t    out viability of attacks that arrange for a crash or for\n\t    presence of notable, confidential information in\n\t    disclosed bytes.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
