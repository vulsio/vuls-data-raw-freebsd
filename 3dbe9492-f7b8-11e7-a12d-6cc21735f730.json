These manipulations can\n\t    alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and\n\t    result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n\t    information.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the\n\t    SP into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable,\n\t    this feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version\n\t    3.1.4, so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD\n\t    exploit has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the\n\t    ports tree already on 2016-07-26.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n     "
