    "text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description</h1>\n\t<p>There are two documented methods of restricting access to\n\t NIS maps through ypserv(8): through the use of the\n\t /var/yp/securenets file, and through the /etc/hosts.allow file.\n\t While both mechanisms are implemented in the server, a change\n\t in the build process caused the \"securenets\" access restrictions\n\t to be inadvertantly disabled.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact</h1>\n\t<p>ypserv(8) will not load or process any of the networks or\n\t  hosts specified in the /var/yp/securenets file, rendering\n\t  those access controls ineffective.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround</h1>\n\t<p>One possible workaround is to use /etc/hosts.allow for access\n\t  control, as shown by examples in that file.</p>\n\t<p>Another workaround is to use a firewall (e.g., ipfw(4),\n\t  ipf(4), or pf(4)) to limit access to RPC functions from\n\t  untrusted systems or networks, but due to the complexities of\n\t  RPC, it might be difficult to create a set of firewall rules\n\t  which accomplish this without blocking all access to the\n\t  machine in question.</p>\n      "
