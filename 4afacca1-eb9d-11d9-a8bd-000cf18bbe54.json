This flaw is due to an input validation error\n\t    in the \"viewtopic.php\" script that does not properly filter\n\t    the \"highlight\" parameter before calling the \"preg_replace()\"\n\t    function, which may be exploited by remote attackers to execute\n\t    arbitrary PHP commands with the privileges of the web server.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
