Old\n\t    versions of FlowPlayer and flashmedia are susceptible to\n\t    Cross-Site Scripting. No authentication is required to exploit\n\t    this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>The file upload component and the File Abstraction Layer are\n\t    failing to check for denied file extensions, which allows\n\t    authenticated editors (even with limited permissions) to\n\t    upload php files with arbitrary code, which can then be\n\t    executed in web server's context.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
