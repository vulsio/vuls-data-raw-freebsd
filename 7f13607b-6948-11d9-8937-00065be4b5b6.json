		"text": "\n      <p>The newspost program uses a function named socket_getline to read\n\tserver responses from the network socket. Unfortunately this function\n\tdoes not check the length of the buffer in which the read data is stored\n\tand only stops reading when a newline character is found.</p>\n      <p>A malicious NNTP server could use this bug to cause a buffer overflow\n\tby sending an overly long response. Such an overflow allows arbitrary\n\tcode to be executed, with the privileges of the newspost process, on the\n\taffected systems.</p>\n    "
