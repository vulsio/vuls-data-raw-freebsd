Currently there is no evidence of an active use of this exploit.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    A patch exists already, is being tested, and backported to all\n\t    versions we released since (and including) 4.87.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The severity depends on your configuration.  It depends on how close to\n\t    the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. The\n\t    closer the better.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
