After this fix,\n\t    file_save_upload() now trims leading and trailing dots from filenames.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-011\">\n\t  <p>The Media Library module has a security vulnerability whereby it\n\t    doesn't sufficiently restrict access to media items in certain\n\t    configurations.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-012\">\n\t  <p>The Drupal project uses the third-party library Archive_Tar, which\n\t    has released a security-related feature that impacts some Drupal\n\t    configurations. Multiple vulnerabilities are possible if Drupal is\n\t    configured to allow .tar, .tar.gz, .bz2 or .tlz file uploads and\n\t    processes them. The latest versions of Drupal update Archive_Tar to\n\t    1.4.9 to mitigate the file processing vulnerabilities.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
