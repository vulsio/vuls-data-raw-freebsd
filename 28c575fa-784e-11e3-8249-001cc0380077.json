Testing in X servers built with\n\t    Stack Protector restulted in an immediate crash when reading a\n\t    user-proveded specially crafted font.</p>\n\t  <p>As libXfont is used to read user-specified font files in all X\n\t    servers distributed by X.Org, including the Xorg server which is\n\t    often run with root privileges or as setuid-root in order to access\n\t    hardware, this bug may lead to an unprivileged user acquiring root\n\t    privileges in some systems.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
