A\n\t  malicious server may exploit these bugs by sending specially\n\t  crafted PROPFIND or PROPPATCH responses.</p>\n\t<p>Although several applications include neon, such as cadaver and\n\t  subversion, the FreeBSD Ports of these applications are not\n\t  impacted.  They are specifically configured to NOT use the\n\t  included neon.  Only packages listed as affected in this\n\t  notice are believed to be impacted.</p>\n      "
