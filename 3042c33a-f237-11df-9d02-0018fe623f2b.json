Servers that are\n\t    multi-process and/or disable internal session caching are NOT\n\t    affected.</p>\n\t  <p>In particular the Apache HTTP server (which never uses OpenSSL\n\t    internal caching) and Stunnel (which includes its own workaround)\n\t    are NOT affected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
