A malicious website can use\n\t   this as part of a session fixation attack. See e.g.\n\t   http://www.acros.si/papers/session_fixation.pdf</p>\n\t <p>Affected are all country specific secondary top level\n\t  domains that use more than 2 characters in the secondary\n\t  part of the domain name and that use a secondary part other\n\t  than com, net, mil, org, gov, edu or int. Examples of\n\t  affected domains are .ltd.uk, .plc.uk and .firm.in</p>\n\t<p>It should be noted that popular domains such as .co.uk, .co.in\n\t  and .com are NOT affected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
