This generally results in crashing the browser,\n\t    but in theory references to deleted objects can be abused to\n\t    run malicious code.</p>\n\t  <p>\"splices\" reported the same crash at the fan site MozillaZine and\n\t    on Bugtraq, incorrectly describing it as a buffer overflow.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
