This is a security release for\n\t    all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your\n\t    sites immediately.</p>\n\t  <p>WordPress versions 4.5.1 and earlier are affected by a SOME\n\t    vulnerability through Plupload, the third-party library WordPress\n\t    uses for uploading files. WordPress versions 4.2 through 4.5.1 are\n\t    vulnerable to reflected XSS using specially crafted URIs through\n\t    MediaElement.js, the third-party library used for media players.\n\t    MediaElement.js and Plupload have also released updates fixing\n\t    these issues.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
