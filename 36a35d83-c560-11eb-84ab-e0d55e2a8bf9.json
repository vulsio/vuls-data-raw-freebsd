It does this by\n\t  sending the unique bus name of the requesting process, which is\n\t  typically something like \":1.96\", to <code>dbus-daemon</code>. These unique names\n\t  are assigned and managed by <code>dbus-daemon</code> and cannot be forged, so this\n\t  is a good way to check the privileges of the requesting process.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability happens when the requesting process disconnects from\n\t  <code>dbus-daemon</code> just before the call to\n\t  <code>polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync</code> starts. In this scenario, the\n\t  unique bus name is no longer valid, so <code>dbus-daemon</code> sends back an error\n\t  reply. This error case is handled in\n\t  <code>polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync</code> by setting the value of the\n\t  <code>error</code> parameter, but it still returns <code>TRUE</code>, rather than <code>FALSE</code>.\n\t  This behavior means that all callers of\n\t  <code>polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync</code> need to carefully check whether\n\t  an error was set. If the calling function forgets to check for errors\n\t  then it will think that the uid of the requesting process is 0 (because\n\t  the <code>AsyncGetBusNameCredsData</code> struct is zero initialized). In other\n\t  words, it will think that the action was requested by a root process,\n\t  and will therefore allow it.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
