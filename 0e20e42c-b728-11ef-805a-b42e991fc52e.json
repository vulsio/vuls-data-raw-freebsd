This flaw, triggered by an\n\tinvalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused\n\truntime errors that disrupted the signature validation process.\n\tAs a result, the enforcement of signature validation for\n\tunrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation\n\tin this context is used to ensure that third-party\n\tapplications on the user's computer have not tampered\n\twith the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this\n\tissue.</li>\n\t<li>CVE-2024-11697: When handling keypress events, an attacker\n\tmay have been able to trick a user into bypassing the \"\n\tOpen Executable File?\" confirmation dialog.  This could\n\thave led to malicious code execution.</li>\n\t<li>CVE-2024-11699: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132,\n\tFirefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4.  Some of these bugs\n\tshowed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with\n\tenough effort some of these could have been exploited to run\n\tarbitrary code.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
