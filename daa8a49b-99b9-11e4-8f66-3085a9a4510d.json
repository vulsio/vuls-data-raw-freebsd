This defect leaves\n\t     applications which pass insanely large inputs to evbuffers open\n\t     to a possible heap overflow or infinite loop. In order to exploit\n\t     this flaw, an attacker needs to be able to find a way to provoke\n\t     the program into trying to make a buffer chunk larger than what\n\t     will fit into a single size_t or off_t.\n\t </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
