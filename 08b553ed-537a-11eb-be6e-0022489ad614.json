When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.</p>\n\t  <h1>HTTP Request Smuggling in nodejs (Low) (CVE-2020-8287)</h1>\n\t  <p>Affected versions of Node.js allow two copies of a header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.</p>\n\t  <h1>OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference (CVE-2020-1971)</h1>\n\t  <p>iThis is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through Node.js. You can read more about it in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
