The ELF image metadata created for this purpose has a\n\t    few unused bytes when the symbol table binary is in 32-bit ELF\n\t    format. These unused bytes were not properly cleared during symbol\n\t    table loading.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious unprivileged guest may be able to obtain sensitive\n\t    information from the host.</p>\n\t  <p>The information leak is small and not under the control of the\n\t    guest, so effectively exploiting this vulnerability is probably\n\t    difficult.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
