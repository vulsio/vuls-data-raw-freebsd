One of them is called `secret_hash` and and the other\n\t    `session_id`. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key\n\t    re-exchange, previous `session_id` is kept and used as an input to new\n\t    `secret_hash`.</p>\n\t  <p>Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which\n\t    worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange\n\t    operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on\n\t    hash of different size, eventually creating `secret_hash` of different\n\t    size than the `session_id` has.</p>\n\t  <p>This becomes an issue when the `session_id` memory is zeroized or when\n\t    it is used again during second key re-exchange.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
