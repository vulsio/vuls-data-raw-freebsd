Since up-imapproxy runs in a single process with each\n\t    connection handled in a separate thread, any crash kills\n\t    all the connections and stops listening for new ones.</p>\n\t  <p>In 64bit systems it might be possible to make it leak\n\t    data (mails, passwords, ..) from other connections to\n\t    attacker's connection. However I don't think up-imapproxy\n\t    actually works in any 64bit system so this is just a\n\t    theoretical problem.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
