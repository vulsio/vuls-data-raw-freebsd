These updates address vulnerabilities\n\t    that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the\n\t    affected system.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve a vulnerability (CVE-2015-3096) that could be\n\t    exploited to bypass the fix for CVE-2014-5333.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates improve memory address randomization of the Flash heap\n\t    for the Window 7 64-bit platform (CVE-2015-3097).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve vulnerabilities that could be exploited to\n\t    bypass the same-origin-policy and lead to information disclosure\n\t    (CVE-2015-3098, CVE-2015-3099, CVE-2015-3102).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve a stack overflow vulnerability that could lead\n\t    to code execution (CVE-2015-3100).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve a permission issue in the Flash broker for\n\t    Internet Explorer that could be exploited to perform privilege\n\t    escalation from low to medium integrity level (CVE-2015-3101).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve an integer overflow vulnerability that could\n\t    lead to code execution (CVE-2015-3104).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve a memory corruption vulnerability that could\n\t    lead to code execution (CVE-2015-3105).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve use-after-free vulnerabilities that could lead\n\t    to code execution (CVE-2015-3103, CVE-2015-3106, CVE-2015-3107).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    These updates resolve a memory leak vulnerability that could be used\n\t    to bypass ASLR (CVE-2015-3108).\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
