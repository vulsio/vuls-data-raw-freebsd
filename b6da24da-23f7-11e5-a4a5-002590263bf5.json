Some attackers may also be able\n\t    to use valid certificates for one domain signed by a global\n\t    Certificate Authority to abuse an unrelated domain.</p>\n\t  <p>However, the bug is exploitable only if you have configured\n\t    Squid to perform SSL Bumping with the \"client-first\" or \"bump\"\n\t    mode of operation.</p>\n\t  <p>Sites that do not use SSL-Bump are not vulnerable.</p>\n\t  <p>All Squid built without SSL support are not vulnerable to the\n\t    problem.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>The FreeBSD port does not use SSL by default and is not vulnerable\n\t  in the default configuration.</p>\n      "
