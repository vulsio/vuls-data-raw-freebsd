Most SIP request types result in an \"artificial\"\n\t  endpoint being looked up, but ACKs bypass this lookup.\n\t  The resulting NULL pointer results in a crash when\n\t  attempting to determine if ACLs should be applied.</p>\n\t  <p>This issue was introduced in the Asterisk 13.10 release\n\t  and only affects that release.</p>\n\t  <p>This issue only affects users using the PJSIP stack\n\t  with Asterisk. Those users that use chan_sip are\n\t  unaffected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
