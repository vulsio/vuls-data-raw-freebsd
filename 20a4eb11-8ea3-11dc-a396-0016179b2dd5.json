This can be exploited\n\t    to execute arbitrary HTML and script code (for example with meta\n\t    refreshes to a javascript: URL) in a user's browser session in\n\t    context of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>Input passed to the local_php and error_handler parameters in\n\t    tiki-index.php is not properly verified before being used to include\n\t    files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local\n\t    resources.</p>\n\t  <p>Input passed to the imp_language parameter in\n\t    tiki-imexport_languages.php is not properly verified before being\n\t    used to include files.  This can be exploited to include arbitrary\n\t    files from local resources.</p>\n\t  <p>Certain img src elements are not properly santised before being\n\t    used.  This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script\n\t    code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an\n\t    affected site when the malicious data is viewed.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
