The\n\t  issue is due to the fact that the Authoritative Server will exit when it runs into a parsing error while\n\t  looking up the NS/A/AAAA records it is about to use for an outgoing notify.</p>\n\t <p>CVE-2019-10163: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing a remote, authorized\n\t  master server to cause a high CPU load or even prevent any further updates to any slave zone by sending\n\t  a large number of NOTIFY messages. Note that only servers configured as slaves are affected by this issue.</p>\n       </blockquote>\n      "
