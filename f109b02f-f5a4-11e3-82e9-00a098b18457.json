Manager users can\n\t    execute arbitrary shell commands with the MixMonitor manager action.\n\t    Asterisk does not require system class authorization for a manager\n\t    user to use the MixMonitor action, so any manager user who is\n\t    permitted to use manager commands can potentially execute shell\n\t    commands as the user executing the Asterisk process.</p>\n\t  <p>Exhaustion of Allowed Concurrent HTTP Connections. Establishing a\n\t    TCP or TLS connection to the configured HTTP or HTTPS port\n\t    respectively in http.conf and then not sending or completing a HTTP\n\t    request will tie up a HTTP session. By doing this repeatedly until the\n\t    maximum number of open HTTP sessions is reached, legitimate requests\n\t    are blocked.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
