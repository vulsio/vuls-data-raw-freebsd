This\n\t  mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid\n\t  state, where the next request sent on the connection will\n\t  fail.</p>\n\t  <p>An attacker sending a request to a\n\t  net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this\n\t  mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect:\n\t  100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational\n\t  response from the backend. Each such request leaves the\n\t  proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent\n\t  request using that connection to fail.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
