		"text": "\n\t<p>The Courier set of mail services use a common Unicode\n\t  library.  This library contains buffer overflows in the\n\t  converters for two popular Japanese character encodings.\n\t  These overflows may be remotely exploitable, triggered by\n\t  a maliciously formatted email message that is later processed\n\t  by one of the Courier mail services.\n\t  From the release notes for the corrected versions of the\n\t  Courier set of mail services:</p>\n\t<blockquote>\n\t  <p>iso2022jp.c: Converters became (upper-)compatible with\n\t    ISO-2022-JP (RFC1468 / JIS X 0208:1997 Annex 2) and\n\t    ISO-2022-JP-1 (RFC2237).  Buffer overflow vulnerability\n\t    (when Unicode character is out of BMP range) has been\n\t    closed.  Convert error handling was implemented.</p>\n\t  <p>shiftjis.c: Broken SHIFT_JIS converters has been fixed\n\t    and became (upper-)compatible with Shifted Encoding Method\n\t    (JIS X 0208:1997 Annex 1). Buffer overflow vulnerability\n\t    (when Unicode character is out of BMP range) has been\n\t    closed.  Convert error handling was implemented.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
