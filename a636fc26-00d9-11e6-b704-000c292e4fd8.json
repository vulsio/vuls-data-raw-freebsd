BADLOCK. A man in the middle can intercept any DCERPC traffic\n\t   between a client and a server in order to impersonate the client and get the same privileges\n\t   as the authenticated user account. This is most problematic against active directory domain controllers.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
