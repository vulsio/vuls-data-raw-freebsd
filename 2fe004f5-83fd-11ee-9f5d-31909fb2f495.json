On platforms where division by zero is fatal, this will cause an OpenVPN crash.\n\t\t<br/>\nReported by Niccolo Belli and WIPocket (Github #400, #417).\n\t</p>\n\t<p>CVE-2023-46850 OpenVPN versions between 2.6.0 and 2.6.6 incorrectly use a send buffer after it has been free()d in some circumstances, causing some free()d memory to be sent to the peer. All configurations using TLS (e.g. not using --secret) are affected by this issue. (found while tracking down CVE-2023-46849 / Github #400, #417)</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
