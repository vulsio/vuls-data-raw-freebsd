This can be exploited to execute\n\t    arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context\n\t    of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>Input passed to the \"rev\" parameter in rss.php is not properly\n\t    sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to overwrite\n\t    arbitrary files via directory traversal attacks.</p>\n\t  <p>Access to restricted repositories is not properly enforced, which\n\t    can be exploited to disclose potentially sensitive information by\n\t    accessing the repository via \"listing.php\" and using the \"compare with\n\t    previous\" and \"show changed files\" links.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
