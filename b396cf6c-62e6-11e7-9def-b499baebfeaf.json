A logical error involving order of validation\n\t      and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from\n\t      a stack buffer (CVE-2017-9224).</li>\n\t    <li>A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val()\n\t      during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff\n\t      are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc().\n\t      A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form\n\t      of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff\n\t      in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory\n\t      corruption (CVE-2017-9226).</li>\n\t    <li>A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular\n\t      expression searching. Invalid handling of reg-&gt;dmin in\n\t      forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference,\n\t      as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer (CVE-2017-9227).</li>\n\t    <li>A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during\n\t      regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from\n\t      an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in\n\t      parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a\n\t      critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index,\n\t      resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption (CVE-2017-9228).</li>\n\t    <li>A SIGSEGV occurs in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression\n\t      compilation. Invalid handling of reg-&gt;dmax in forward_search_range() could\n\t      result in an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate\n\t      denial-of-service condition (CVE-2017-9228).</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
