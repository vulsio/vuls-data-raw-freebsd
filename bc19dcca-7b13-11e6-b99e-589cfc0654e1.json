This could be a problem if scripts\n\t     or webpages pass untrusted input to the dbclient program.</p>\n\t  <p>dropbearconvert import of OpenSSH keys could run arbitrary code as\n\t     the local dropbearconvert user when parsing malicious key files.</p>\n\t  <p>dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if\n\t     particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where\n\t     dbclient is used in scripts.</p>\n\t  <p>dbclient or dropbear server could expose process memory to the\n\t     running user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
