Improper validation of\n\t    client-provided data can cause data corruption.</p>\n\t  <p>Exploiting these overflows will crash the X server or,\n\t    under certain circumstances allow the execution of arbitray machine\n\t    code.</p>\n\t  <p>When the X server is running with root privileges (which is the case\n\t    for the Xorg server and for most kdrive based servers), these\n\t    vulnerabilities can thus also be used to raise privileges.</p>\n\t  <p>All these vulnerabilities, to be exploited successfully, require either\n\t    an already established connection to a running X server (and normally\n\t    running X servers are only accepting authenticated connections), or a\n\t    shell access with a valid user on the machine where the vulnerable\n\t    server is installed.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
