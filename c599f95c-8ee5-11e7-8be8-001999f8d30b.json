When combined with the symmetric\n\t  RTP support this introduced an avenue where media could\n\t  be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when\n\t  expected the new code allowed a new source address to be\n\t  learned at all times.</p>\n\t  <p>AST-2017-006 - The app_minivm module has an \"externnotify\"\n\t  program configuration option that is executed by the\n\t  MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses\n\t  the caller-id name and number as part of a built string\n\t  passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution.\n\t  Since the caller-id name and number can come from an\n\t  untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number\n\t  allows an arbitrary shell command injection.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
