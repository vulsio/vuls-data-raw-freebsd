The\n\t    attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken\n\t    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag pointing at the victim's\n\t    phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially\n\t    deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE\n\t    statement) through the victim.</p>\n\n\t  <h3>Severity</h3>\n\t  <p>We consider this vulnerability to be severe.</p>\n\n\n\t  <h3>Mitigation factor</h3> <p>Only the 'cookie'\n\t    auth_type is affected; users can temporary use\n\t    phpMyAdmin's http authentication as a workaround.</p>\n\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
