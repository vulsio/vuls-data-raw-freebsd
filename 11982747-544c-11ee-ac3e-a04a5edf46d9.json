We therefore advise all\n\t  users of Routinator to upgrade to this release at their earliest\n\t  convenience.</p>\n\t  <p>The first issue, CVE-2022-39915, can lead to Routinator crashing\n\t  when trying to decode certain illegal RPKI objects.</p>\n\t  <p>The second issue, CVE-2022-39916, only affects users that have the\n\t  rrdp-keep-responses option enabled which allows storing all received\n\t  RRDP responses on disk. Because the file name for these responses is\n\t  derived from the URI and the path wasn't checked properly, a RRDP URI\n\tcould be constructed that results in the response stored outside the\n\tdirectory, possibly overwriting existing files.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
