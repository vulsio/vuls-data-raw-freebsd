This allows a hacker to run any arbitrary command as root\n\t    under the guise of updating the time.</p>\n\t  <p>An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with\n\t    either misleading information or no interaction.</p>\n\t  <p>On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the\n\t    time. However, if the system has policykit-desktop-privileges\n\t    installed, the datetime helper will be invoked by an admin user\n\t    without any prompts.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
