For instance, this\n\t     vulnerability affects web application that parses the JSON data\n\t     sent from untrusted entity.</p>\n\t  <p>This vulnerability is similar to CVS-2011-4815 for ruby 1.8.7. ruby\n\t     1.9 versions were using modified MurmurHash function but it's\n\t     reported that there is a way to create sequence of strings that\n\t     collide their hash values each other.  This fix changes the Hash\n\t     function of String object from the MurmurHash to SipHash 2-4.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
