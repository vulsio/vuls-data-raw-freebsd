Under certain error conditions,\n\t  user defined data will be copied into a stack allocated buffer\n\t  stored in the kernel without sufficient bounds checking.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>If the system is configured to allow unprivileged users to\n\t  mount file systems, it is possible for a local adversary to\n\t  exploit this vulnerability and execute code in the context of\n\t  the kernel.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround:</h1>\n\t<p>It is possible to work around this issue by allowing only\n\t  privileged users to mount file systems by running the\n\t  following sysctl(8) command:</p>\n\t<pre># sysctl vfs.usermount=0</pre>\n      "
