The overflows can manifest as a segmentation fault or as\n\t    memory corruption during a parse operation. The bugs allow for a\n\t    denial of service attack in many applications by an unauthenticated\n\t    attacker, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
