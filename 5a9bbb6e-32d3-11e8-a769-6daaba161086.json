This debugger service was vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution.</p>\n\t  <h1>'path' module regular expression denial of service (CVE-2018-7158)</h1>\n\t  <p>The 'path' module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x.</p>\n\t  <h1>Spaces in HTTP Content-Length header values are ignored (CVE-2018-7159)</h1>\n\t  <p>The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the Content-Length header, allowing input such as Content-Length: 1 2 to be interpreted as having a value of 12. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the Content-Length value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
