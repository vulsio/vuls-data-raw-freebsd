This is a hotfix\n\t release, that contains a single patch to address a security issue in\n\t cloud-init 20.4.</p>\n\n\t <p>Briefly, for users who provide more than one unique SSH key to\n\t cloud-init and have a shared AuthorizedKeysFile configured in\n\t sshd_config, cloud-init 20.4 started writing all of these keys to such a\n\t file, granting all such keys SSH access as root.</p>\n\n\t <p>It's worth restating this implication: if you are using the default\n\t AuthorizedKeysFile setting in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, as most will be,\n\t then you are _not_ affected by this issue.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
