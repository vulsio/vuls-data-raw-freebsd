An\n\t    attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to\n\t    recover the private key (Low).</p>\n\t  <p>Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0734):\n\t    Avoid a timing attack that leaks information via a side channel\n\t    that triggers when a BN is resized.  Increasing the size of the\n\t    BNs prior to doing anything with them suppresses the attack (Low).\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
