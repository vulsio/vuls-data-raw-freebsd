Another vulnerability\n\t      enables cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which has the similar\n\t      consequence. Another vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass\n\t      the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF\n\t      attackes. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to\n\t      Jenkins to mount an attack.</li>\n\t    <li>In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick\n\t      Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.</li>\n\t    <li>And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to\n\t      mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted\n\t      payload to Jenkins.</li>\n\t  </ol>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
