This could include sensitive contents of\n\t    previously freed memory.</p>\n\t  <p>RFC 3779 data can be included in certificates, and if\n\t    it is malformed, may trigger an assertion failure.\n\t    This could be used in a denial-of-service attack.</p>\n\t  <p>Support for handshake restarts for server gated\n\t    cryptograpy (SGC) can be used in a denial-of-service\n\t    attack.</p>\n\t  <p>A malicious TLS client can send an invalid set of GOST\n\t    parameters which will cause the server to crash due to\n\t    lack of error checking.  This could be used in a\n\t    denial-of-service attack.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
