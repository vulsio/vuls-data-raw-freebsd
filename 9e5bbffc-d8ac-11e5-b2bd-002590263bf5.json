It is recommended that application\n\t    developers take further measures such as using a restricted class\n\t    loader when deserializing. See notes on Java serialization security\n\t    XStream security and How to secure deserialization from untrusted\n\t    input without using encryption or sealing.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
