This scenario would require the attacker to get the VS Code user to open the malicious project and have get the user to open and work with malformed entries in the dependencies sections of the package.json file.</p>\n\t  <p>VS Code uses the locally installed npm command to fetch information on package dependencies. A package dependency can be named in such a way that the npm tool runs a script instead.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
