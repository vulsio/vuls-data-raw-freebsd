This means that confidential information could\n\t     be disclosed to the addressee if the other user has more\n\t     privileges than the addressee.\n\t     Plain text bugmails are not affected as bug and attachment\n\t     IDs are not linkified.</p>\n\t  <h1>Information Leak</h1>\n\t  <p>Versions: 2.17.5 to 3.6.9, 3.7.1 to 4.0.6, 4.1.1 to\n\t      4.2.1, 4.3.1</p>\n\t  <p>The description of a private attachment could be visible\n\t     to a user who hasn't permissions to access this attachment\n\t     if the attachment ID is mentioned in a public comment in\n\t     a bug that the user can see.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
