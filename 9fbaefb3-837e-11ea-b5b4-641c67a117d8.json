This\n\tmitigates CVE-2019-12387. Thanks to Alex Brasetvik for reporting this\n\tvulnerability.</p>\n\t<p>The HTTP/2 server implementation now enforces TCP flow control on\n\tcontrol frame messages and times out clients that send invalid data\n\twithout reading responses. This closes CVE-2019-9512 (Ping Flood),\n\tCVE-2019-9514 (Reset Flood), and CVE-2019-9515 (Settings Flood). Thanks\n\tto Jonathan Looney and Piotr Sikora.</p>\n\t<p>twisted.web.http was subject to several request smuggling attacks.\n\tRequests with multiple Content-Length headers were allowed\n\t(CVE-2020-10108, thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox and ZeddYu Lu\n\tfor reporting this) and now fail with a 400; requests with a\n\tContent-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header honored the first\n\theader (CVE-2020-10109, thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox for\n\treporting this) and now fail with a 400; requests whose\n\tTransfer-Encoding header had a value other than \"chunked\" and\n\t\"identity\" (thanks to ZeddYu Lu) were allowed and now fail with a 400.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
