In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New\n\t    ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new\n\t    redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an\n\t    attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the\n\t    /new endpoint. If a user visits a prometheus server with a\n\t    specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary\n\t    URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In\n\t    2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The\n\t    workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in\n\t    front of Prometheus.\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
