There are reports that this vulnerability\n\t    is being exploited in the wild in targeted attacks via a\n\t    malicious Web page or a Flash (.swf) file embedded in a\n\t    Microsoft Word (.doc) or Microsoft Excel (.xls) file\n\t    delivered as an email attachment, targeting the Windows\n\t    platform. At this time, Adobe is not aware of any attacks\n\t    via PDF targeting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Adobe Reader\n\t    X Protected Mode mitigations would prevent an exploit of\n\t    this kind from executing.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
