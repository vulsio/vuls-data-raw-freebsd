The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\t    identifies the following problems:</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2007-1320<br/>Tavis Ormandy discovered that a memory management\n\t    routine of the Cirrus video driver performs insufficient bounds\n\t    checking, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code through\n\t    a heap overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2007-1321<br/>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network\n\t    driver and the socket code perform insufficient input validation,\n\t    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code through a heap\n\t    overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2007-1322<br/>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the \"icebp\"\n\t    instruction can be abused to terminate the emulation, resulting in\n\t    denial of service.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2007-1323<br/>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network\n\t    driver and the socket code perform insufficient input validation,\n\t    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code through a heap\n\t    overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2007-1366<br/>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the \"aam\"\n\t    instruction can be abused to crash qemu through a division by zero,\n\t    resulting in denial of service.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
