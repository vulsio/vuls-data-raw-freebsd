This vulnerability can be used to attack Jenkins inside\n\t    firewalls from outside so long as the location of Jenkins is known\n\t    to the attacker.</p>\n\t  <h5>SECURITY-180 (forced API token change)</h5>\n\t  <p>The part of Jenkins that issues a new API token was not\n\t    adequately protected against anonymous attackers. This allows an\n\t    attacker to escalate privileges on Jenkins.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
