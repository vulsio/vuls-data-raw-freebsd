This bug can be exploited both\n\t    locally or remotely (via a remote X client or an X client\n\t    which visits a malicious web page).  A working\n\t    proof-of-concept root exploit is included with this\n\t    advisory.</p>\n\t  <p>The NVIDIA drivers for Solaris and FreeBSD are also\n\t    likely to be vulnerable.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<p>Disabling Render acceleration in the \"nvidia\" driver, via\n\t  the \"RenderAccel\" X configuration option, can be used as a\n\t  workaround for this issue.</p>\n      "
