For the panic to happen,\n\t    the divisor or modulo argument must be larger than 3168 bits\n\t    (on 32-bit architectures) or 6336 bits (on 64-bit architectures).\n\t    Multiple math/big.Rat methods are similarly affected.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42556\">\n\t  <p>The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when\n\t    cgo is in use. This may occur when running go get on a malicious\n\t    package, or any other command that builds untrusted code.  This\n\t    can be caused by a malicious gcc flags specified via a #cgo\n\t    directive.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42559\">\n\t  <p>The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when\n\t    cgo is in use.
