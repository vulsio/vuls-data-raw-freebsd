WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this\n\t      issue, but weâ€™ve added hardening to prevent plugins and\n\t      themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability.</li>\n\t    <li>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the\n\t      posts list table.</li>\n\t    <li>An unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability was\n\t      discovered in a REST API endpoint.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
