Having a weak or virtually non-existent\n\t    random there makes these operations vulnerable.</p>\n\t  <p>This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an\n\t    overhaul to make sure libcurl uses strong random as much as\n\t    possible - provided by the backend TLS crypto libraries when\n\t    present. The faulty function was introduced in this commit.</p>\n\t  <p>We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
