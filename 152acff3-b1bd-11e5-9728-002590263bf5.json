It occurs during VM\n\t    guest migration, as more(16 bytes) data is moved into allocated\n\t    (8 bytes) memory area.</p>\n\t  <p>A privileged guest user could use this issue to corrupt the VM\n\t    guest image, potentially leading to a DoS. This issue affects q35\n\t    machine types.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
