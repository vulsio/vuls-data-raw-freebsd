A posting by the rssh\n\t  author explains:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&amp;m=108787373022844\">\n\t  <p>The cause of the problem identified by Mr. McCaw is that\n\t    rssh expanded command-line arguments prior to entering\n\t    the chroot jail.  This bug DOES NOT allow a user to\n\t    access any of the files outside the jail, but can allow\n\t    them to discover what files are in a directory which is\n\t    outside the jail, if their credentials on the server would\n\t    normally allow them read/execute access in the specified\n\t    directory.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
