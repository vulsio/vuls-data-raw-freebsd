Subsequent formulas can operate on\n\t     that inserted data and construct a remote URL whose path leaks the local\n\t     data to a remote attacker.</p>\n\t  <p>In later versions of LibreOffice without this flaw, WEBSERVICE has now\n\t     been limited to accessing http and https URLs along with bringing\n\t     WEBSERVICE URLs under LibreOffice Calc's link management infrastructure.</p>\n\t   <p><strong>Note:</strong> This vulnerability has been identified upstream\n\t     as CVE-2018-1055, but NVD/Mitre are advising it's a reservation\n\t     duplicate of CVE-2018-6871 which should be used instead.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
