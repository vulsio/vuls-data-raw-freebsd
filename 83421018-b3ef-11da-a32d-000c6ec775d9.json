A malicious SWF must be loaded in Flash\n\t    Player by the user for an attacker to exploit these\n\t    vulnerabilities.</p>\n\t  <p>Flash Player 8 update (8.0.24.0), and Flash Player 7\n\t    update (7.0.63.0) address security vulnerabilities in\n\t    previous versions of Flash Player, which could lead to the\n\t    potential execution of arbitrary code. These\n\t    vulnerabilities could be accessed through content\n\t    delivered from a remote location via the users web\n\t    browser, email client, or other applications that include\n\t    or reference the Flash Player.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
