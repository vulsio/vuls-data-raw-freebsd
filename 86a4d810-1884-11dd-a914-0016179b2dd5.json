This issue is caused by a buffer overflow error in the\n\t    ws_getpostvars() function when processing a negative Content-Length:\n\t    header value, which could be exploited by remote unauthenticated\n\t    attackers to crash an affected application or execute arbitrary\n\t    code.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
