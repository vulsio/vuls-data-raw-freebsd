Bossi Bonin has discovered a weakness in xine-lib,\n\t    which can be exploited by malicious people to crash certain\n\t    applications on a user's system.</p>\n\t  <p>The weakness is cause due to a heap corruption within the\n\t    \"xineplug_inp_http.so\" plugin when handling an overly large\n\t    reply from the HTTP server. This can be exploited to crash\n\t    an application that uses the plugin (e.g. gxine).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
