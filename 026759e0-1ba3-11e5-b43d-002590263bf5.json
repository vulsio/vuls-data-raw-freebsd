The vulnerability allows an attacker to\n\t    construct Groovy scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell\n\t    commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM.</p>\n\t  <p>Remediation Summary: Users should upgrade to 1.3.8 or 1.4.3. Users\n\t    that do not want to upgrade can address the vulnerability by setting\n\t    script.groovy.sandbox.enabled to false in elasticsearch.yml and\n\t    restarting the node.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
