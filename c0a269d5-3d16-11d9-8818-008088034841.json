    "text": "\n\t<p>The argument parser of the fetch command suffers a bug very\n\t  similiar to the partial command problem. Arguments like\n\t  \"body[p\", \"binary[p\" or \"binary[p\" will be wrongly detected\n\t  and the bufferposition can point outside of the allocated\n\t  buffer for the rest of the parsing process. When the parser\n\t  triggers the PARSE_PARTIAL macro after such a malformed\n\t  argument was received this can lead to a similiar one byte\n\t  memory corruption and allows remote code execution, when the\n\t  heap layout was successfully controlled by the attacker.</p>\n      "
