Security scope: a malicious openvpn peer can send garbage to openvpn log, or cause high CPU load. (Reynir Björnsson)</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2024-28882: only call schedule_exit() once (on a given peer). Security scope: an authenticated client can make the server \"keep the session\" even when the server has been told to disconnect this client. (Reynir Björnsson)</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
