A successful attack requires that (a) the client has\n\t    agreed to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by\n\t    including \"pull\" or the macro \"client\" in its configuration file,\n\t    (b) the client succesfully authenticates the server, (c) the server\n\t    is malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of the\n\t    attacker, and (d) the client is running a non-Windows OS.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
