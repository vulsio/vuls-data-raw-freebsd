		"text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description</h1>\n\t<p>Two problems related to extraction of files exist in gzip:</p>\n\t<p>The first problem is that gzip does not properly sanitize\n\t  filenames containing \"/\" when uncompressing files using the\n\t  -N command line option.</p>\n\t<p>The second problem is that gzip does not set permissions on\n\t  newly extracted files until after the file has been created\n\t  and the file descriptor has been closed.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact</h1>\n\t<p>The first problem can allow an attacker to overwrite\n\t  arbitrary local files when uncompressing a file using the -N\n\t  command line option.</p>\n\t<p>The second problem can allow a local attacker to change the\n\t  permissions of arbitrary local files, on the same partition\n\t  as the one the user is uncompressing a file on, by removing\n\t  the file the user is uncompressing and replacing it with a\n\t  hardlink before the uncompress operation is finished.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround</h1>\n\t<p>Do not use the -N command line option on untrusted files\n\t  and do not uncompress files in directories where untrusted\n\t  users have write access.</p>\n      "
