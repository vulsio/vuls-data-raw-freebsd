On\n\t    systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an\n\t    integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes).\n\t    This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually\n\t    get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of\n\t    that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.</p>\n\t  <p>This bug is almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
