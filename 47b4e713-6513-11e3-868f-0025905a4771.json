The parser within\n\t    this helper function is not binary safe and can therefore be\n\t    tricked to write up to five NUL bytes outside of an allocated\n\t    buffer.</p>\n\t  <p>This problem can be triggered by x509 certificates that contain\n\t    NUL bytes in their notBefore and notAfter timestamp fields and\n\t    leads to a memory corruption that might result in arbitrary\n\t    code execution.</p>\n\t  <p>Depending on how openssl_x509_parse() is used within a PHP\n\t    application the attack requires either a malicious cert signed\n\t    by a compromised/malicious CA or can be carried out with a\n\t    self-signed cert.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
