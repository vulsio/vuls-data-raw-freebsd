    "text": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description</h1>\n\t<p>IPv6 routers may allow \"on-link\" IPv6 nodes to create and\n\t  update the router's neighbor cache and forwarding\n\t  information.  A malicious IPv6 node sharing a common router\n\t  but on a different physical segment from another node may be\n\t  able to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing it to\n\t  update router information for the victim node.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>An attacker on a different physical network connected to the\n\t  same IPv6 router as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic\n\t  intended for that node.  This could lead to denial of service\n\t  or improper access to private network traffic.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround:</h1>\n\t<p>Firewall packet filters can be used to filter incoming\n\t  Neighbor Solicitation messages but may interfere with normal\n\t  IPv6 operation if not configured carefully.</p>\n\t<p>Reverse path forwarding checks could be used to make\n\t  gateways, such as routers or firewalls, drop Neighbor\n\t  Solicitation messages from nodes with unexpected source\n\t  addresses on a particular interface.</p>\n\t<p>IPv6 router administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756\n\t  for further discussion of Neighbor Discovery security\n\t  implications.</p>\n      "
