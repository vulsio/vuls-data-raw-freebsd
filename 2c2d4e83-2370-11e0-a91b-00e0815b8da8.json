(The CTR counter\n\t    is correctly incremented after each 16 bytes of data was processed,\n\t    but this counter is reset to zero for each new chunk.)</p>\n\t  <p>Note that since the Tarsnap client-server protocol is encrypted,\n\t    being able to intercept Tarsnap client-server traffic does not\n\t    provide an attacker with access to the data.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
