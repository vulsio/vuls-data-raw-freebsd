For which they then show that it can be used to\n\t    mount an attack on the RSA key. Although their test attack is\n\t    done on a local system, there seems to be enough indication\n\t    that this can properly be performed from a remote system as\n\t    well.</p>\n\t  <p>All versions prior to PolarSSL 1.2.9 and 1.3.0 are affected\n\t    if a third party can send arbitrary handshake messages to your\n\t    server.</p>\n\t  <p>If correctly executed, this attack reveals the entire private\n\t    RSA key after a large number of attack messages (&gt; 600.000 on\n\t    a local machine) are sent to show the timing differences.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
