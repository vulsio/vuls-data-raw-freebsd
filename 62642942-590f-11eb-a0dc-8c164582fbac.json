Use of a non-standard\n\t  PostScript operator can allow overriding of file access\n\t  controls. The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size\n\t  resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow\n\t  to max uint32_t. This was fixed in commit\n\t  5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
