This occurs as the code\n\t  does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters.\n\t  This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured\n\t  in Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to\n\t  be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or\n\t  anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still\n\t  processed and the crash occurs.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
