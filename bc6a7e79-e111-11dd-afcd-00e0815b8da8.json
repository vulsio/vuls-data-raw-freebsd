This can be exploited\n\t    to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser\n\t    session in context of an affected site.</p>\n\t  <p>Successful exploitation may require that the victim uses Internet\n\t    Explorer or a browser based on Internet Explorer components.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
