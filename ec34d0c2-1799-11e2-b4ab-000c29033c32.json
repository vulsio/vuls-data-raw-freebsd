External entities can be\n\t    specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE element to XML-RPC\n\t    requests. By exploiting this vulnerability an application may be\n\t    coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.</p>\n\t  <p>Additionally, the Zend_Dom, Zend_Feed, Zend_Soap, and\n\t    Zend_XmlRpc components are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion\n\t    (XEE) vectors, leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE attacks\n\t    occur when the XML DOCTYPE declaration includes XML entity\n\t    definitions that contain either recursive or circular references;\n\t    this leads to CPU and memory consumption, making Denial of\n\t    Service exploits trivial to implement.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
