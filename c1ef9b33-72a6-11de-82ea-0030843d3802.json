In certain cases after a\n\t    return from a native function, such as escape(), the Just-in-Time\n\t    (JIT) compiler could get into a corrupt state. This could be exploited\n\t    by an attacker to run arbitrary code such as installing malware.</p>\n\t  <p>This vulnerability does not affect earlier versions of Firefox\n\t    which do not support the JIT feature.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
