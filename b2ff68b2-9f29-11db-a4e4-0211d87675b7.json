When checking for matching asm rules, the code\n\tstores the results in a fixed-size array, but no boundary checks are\n\tperformed. This may lead to a buffer overflow if the user is tricked\n\tinto connecting to a malicious server. Since the attacker cannot write\n\tarbitrary data into the buffer, creating an exploit is very hard; but a\n\tDoS attack is easily made.\n\tA fix for this problem was committed to SVN on Sun Dec 31 13:27:53 2006\n\tUTC as r21799. The fix involves three files: stream/realrtsp/asmrp.c,\n\tstream/realrtsp/asmrp.h and stream/realrtsp/real.c.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
