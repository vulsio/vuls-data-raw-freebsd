    "text": "\n      <p>\n\tA vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack'\n\t(NRDelegation Attack) has been discovered in various DNS\n\tresolving software. The NRDelegation Attack works by having\n\ta malicious delegation with a considerable number of non\n\tresponsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a\n\tresolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive\n\tnameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot\n\tof time/resources resolving records under a malicious\n\tdelegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive\n\tNS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some\n\tresolver implementations that continually look in the cache\n\tfor resolved NS records in that delegation.\n      </p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-3204\">\n\t  <p>.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
