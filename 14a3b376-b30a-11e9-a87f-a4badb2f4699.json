This interface was erroneously made\n\taccessible to userland, allowing users with read access to\n\ta cd(4) device to arbitrarily overwrite kernel memory when\n\tsome media is present in the device.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>A user in the operator group can make use of this interface\n\tto gain root privileges on a system with a cd(4) device\n\twhen some media is present in the device.</p>\n      "
