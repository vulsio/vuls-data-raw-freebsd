It contains patches relating to redactions and event federation:</p>\n\t  <ul>\n\t    <li>Prevent an attack where a federated server could send redactions for arbitrary events in v1 and v2 rooms.</li>\n\t    <li>Prevent a denial-of-service attack where cycles of redaction events would make Synapse spin infinitely.</li>\n\t    <li>Prevent an attack where users could be joined or parted from public rooms without their consent.</li>\n\t    <li>Fix a vulnerability where a federated server could spoof read-receipts from users on other servers. </li>\n\t    <li>It was possible for a room moderator to send a redaction for an m.room.create event, which would downgrade the room to version 1.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
