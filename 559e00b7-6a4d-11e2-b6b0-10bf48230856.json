This vulnerability, which could\n\t      potentially be used to expose information and compromise a\n\t      site, affects all previous WordPress versions. This was fixed\n\t      by the WordPress security team. We'd like to thank security\n\t      researchers <a href=\"http://codeseekah.com/\">Gennady\n\t      Kovshenin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/\">Ryan\n\t      Dewhurst</a> for reviewing our work.</li>\n\t    <li>Two instances of cross-site scripting via shortcodes and post\n\t      content. These issues were discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress\n\t      security team.</li>\n\t    <li>A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the external library\n\t      Plupload. Thanks to the Moxiecode team for working with us on\n\t      this, and for releasing Plupload 1.5.5 to address this issue.</li>\n\t    </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
