See directives\n\t    DeflateInflateLimitRequestBody, DeflateInflateRatioLimit,\n\t    and DeflateInflateRatioBurst.</p>\n\t  <p>mod_cgid: Fix a denial of service against CGI scripts that do\n\t    not consume stdin that could lead to lingering HTTPD child processes\n\t    filling up the scoreboard and eventually hanging the server.  By\n\t    default, the client I/O timeout (Timeout directive) now applies to\n\t    communication with scripts.  The CGIDScriptTimeout directive can be\n\t    used to set a different timeout for communication with scripts.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
