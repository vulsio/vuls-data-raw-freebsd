This could be\n\t      used to cause 'svnlook', and hence check-mime-type.pl, to error out.</p>\n\t    <p>The script contrib/hook-scripts/svn-keyword-check.pl parses filenames\n\t      from the output of 'svnlook changed' and passes them to a further\n\t      shell command (equivalent to the 'system()' call of the C standard\n\t      library) without escaping them.  This could be used to run arbitrary\n\t      shell commands in the context of the user whom the pre-commit script\n\t      runs as (the user who owns the repository).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
