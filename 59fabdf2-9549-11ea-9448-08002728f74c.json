This allows an attacker\n\t    to verify whether a backend user account with a given email address\n\t    exists or not.</p>\n\t  <p/>\n\t  <p>CVE-2020-11064: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-002: Cross-Site Scripting in Form\n\t    Engine</p>\n\t  <p>It has been discovered that HTML placeholder attributes containing\n\t    data of other database records are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. A\n\t    valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p/>\n\t  <p>CVE-2020-11065: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-003: Cross-Site Scripting in Link\n\t    Handling</p>\n\t  <p>It has been discovered that link tags generated by typolink\n\t    functionality are vulnerable to cross-site scripting - properties being\n\t    assigned as HTML attributes have not been parsed correctly.</p>\n\t  <p/>\n\t  <p>CVE-2020-11066: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-004: Class destructors causing\n\t    side-effects when being unserialized</p>\n\t  <p>Calling unserialize() on malicious user-submitted content can result\n\t    in the following scenarios:</p>\n\t  <p>- trigger deletion of arbitrary directory in file system (if writable\n\t    for web server)</p>\n\t  <p>- trigger message submission via email using identity of web site\n\t    (mail relay)</p>\n\t  <p>Another insecure deserialization vulnerability is required to actually\n\t    exploit mentioned aspects.</p>\n\t  <p/>\n\t  <p>CVE-2020-11067: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-005: Insecure Deserialization in\n\t    Backend User Settings</p>\n\t  <p>It has been discovered that backend user settings (in $BE_USER-&gt;uc) are\n\t    vulnerable to insecure deserialization. In combination with\n\t    vulnerabilities of 3rd party components this can lead to remote code\n\t    execution. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this\n\t    vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p/>\n\t  <p>CVE-2020-11069: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-006: Same-Site Request Forgery to\n\t    Backend User Interface</p>\n\t  <p>It has been discovered that the backend user interface and install tool\n\t    are vulnerable to same-site request forgery. A backend user can be\n\t    tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker\n\t    previously managed to upload to the web server - scripts are then\n\t    executed with the privileges of the victims’ user session.</p>\n\t  <p>In a worst case scenario new admin users can be created which can\n\t    directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a\n\t    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting\n\t    vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it’\n\t    actually a same-site request forgery (SSRF).</p>\n\t  <p>Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided\n\t    by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user\n\t    using a 3rd party extension - e.g. file upload in a contact form with\n\t    knowing the target location.</p>\n\t  <p>The attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install\n\t    tool user session at the time of the attack to be successful.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
