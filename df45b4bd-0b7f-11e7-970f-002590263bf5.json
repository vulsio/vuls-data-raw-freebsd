We highly\n\t    recommend that you upgrade your sites as soon as possible.\n\t    Upgrading should be very straightforward. As per our usual policy,\n\t    admins of all registered Moodle sites will be notified of security\n\t    issue details directly via email and we'll publish details more\n\t    widely in a week.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
