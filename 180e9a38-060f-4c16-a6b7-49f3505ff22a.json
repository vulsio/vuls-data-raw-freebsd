		"text": "\n\t<h1>Problem description and impact</h1>\n\t<p>When running on processors supporting Hyper-Threading Technology, it\n\t  is possible for a malicious thread to monitor the execution of another\n\t  thread.</p>\n\t<p>Information may be disclosed to local users, allowing in many\n\t  cases for privilege escalation.  For example, on a multi-user\n\t  system, it may be possible to steal cryptographic keys used in\n\t  applications such as OpenSSH or SSL-enabled web servers.</p>\n\t<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Similar problems may exist in other\n\t  simultaneous multithreading implementations, or even some\n\t  systems in the absence of simultaneous multithreading.\n\t  However, current research has only demonstrated this flaw in\n\t  Hyper-Threading Technology, where shared memory caches are\n\t  used.</p>\n\t<h1>Workaround</h1>\n\t<p>Systems not using processors with Hyper-Threading Technology\n\t  support are not affected by this issue.  On systems which are\n\t  affected, the security flaw can be eliminated by setting the\n\t  \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus\" tunable:</p>\n\t<pre># echo \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus=1\" &gt;&gt; /boot/loader.conf</pre>\n\t<p>The system must be rebooted in order for tunables to take effect.</p>\n\t<p>Use of this workaround is not recommended on \"dual-core\" systems, as\n\t  this workaround will also disable one of the processor\n\t  cores.</p>\n      "
