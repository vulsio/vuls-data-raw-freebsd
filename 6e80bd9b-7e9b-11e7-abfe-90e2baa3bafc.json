Such a URL could be generated by a malicious\n\t  server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack another\n\t  user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://,\n\t  http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.</p>\n\t  <p>An exploit has been tested.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
