This is\n\t    related to an allocation vulnerability in the APR library\n\t    used by Subversion.</p>\n\t  <p>Clients with commit access to a vulnerable server can\n\t    cause a remote heap overflow; servers can cause a heap\n\t    overflow on vulnerable clients that try to do a checkout\n\t    or update.</p>\n\t  <p>This can lead to a DoS (an exploit has been tested) and\n\t    to arbitrary code execution (no exploit tested, but the\n\t    possibility is clear).</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
