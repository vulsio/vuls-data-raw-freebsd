It expects the paths in the REPORT request\n\t    to be absolute URLs.  Serf based clients send relative URLs instead\n\t    of absolute URLs in many cases.  As a result these clients are not blocked\n\t    as configured by mod_dontdothat.</p>\n\t  <p>mod_dav_svn assertion triggered by non-canonical URLs in autoversioning commits</p>\n\t  <p>When SVNAutoversioning is enabled via SVNAutoversioning on\n\t    commits can be made by single HTTP requests such as MKCOL and\n\t    PUT.  If Subversion is built with assertions enabled any such\n\t    requests that have non-canonical URLs, such as URLs with a\n\t    trailing /, may trigger an assert.  An assert will cause the\n\t    Apache process to abort.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
