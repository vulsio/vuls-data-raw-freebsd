The vulnerability\n\tallows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process.\n\tOn non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an\n\tout-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no\n\tdenial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This\n\tissue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\tThere are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
