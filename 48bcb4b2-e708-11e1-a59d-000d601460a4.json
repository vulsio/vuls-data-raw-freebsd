We are aware of a working exploit,\n\t    which can lead to arbitrary code execution. A valid backend user\n\t    login or multiple successful cross site request forgery attacks are\n\t    required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>TYPO3 Backend - Failing to properly HTML-encode user input in\n\t    several places, the TYPO3 backend is susceptible to Cross-Site\n\t    Scripting. A valid backend user is required to exploit these\n\t    vulnerabilities.</p>\n\t  <p>TYPO3 Backend - Accessing the configuration module discloses the\n\t    Encryption Key. A valid backend user with access to the\n\t    configuration module is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>TYPO3 HTML Sanitizing API - By not removing several HTML5\n\t    JavaScript events, the API method t3lib_div::RemoveXSS() fails to\n\t    filter specially crafted HTML injections, thus is susceptible to\n\t    Cross-Site Scripting. Failing to properly encode for JavaScript the\n\t    API method t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue(), it is susceptible to Cross-Site\n\t    Scripting.</p>\n\t  <p>TYPO3 Install Tool - Failing to properly sanitize user input, the\n\t    Install Tool is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
