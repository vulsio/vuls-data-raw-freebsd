Thus a user that was\n\t    allowed to use the SetEnv directive in a .htaccess file (AllowOverride\n\t    FileInfo) could make PHP load a malicious configuration file (e.g.\n\t    loading malicious extensions).</p>\n\t  <p>As the PHP process for highlighting the source file was run with the\n\t    privileges of the user Apache HTTPd was running as, a local attacker\n\t    could probably execute arbitrary code with the privileges of this user.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
