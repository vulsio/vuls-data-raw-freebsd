But boolean charts\n\t      let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly\n\t      disclosing group membership. This security fix\n\t      restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user\n\t      belongs to.</li>\n\t    <li>Notification Bypass:\n\t      Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives\n\t      an email informing him that he is being impersonated,\n\t      containing the identity of the impersonator. However,\n\t      it was possible to impersonate a user without this\n\t      notification being sent.</li>\n\t    <li>Remote Information Disclosure:\n\t      An error message thrown by the \"Reports\" and \"Duplicates\"\n\t      page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus\n\t      allowing users to guess confidential product names.\n\t      (Note that the \"Duplicates\" page was not vulnerable\n\t      in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)</li>\n\t    <li>Denial of Service:\n\t      If a comment contained the phrases \"bug X\" or\n\t      \"attachment X\", where X was an integer larger than the\n\t      maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would\n\t      throw an error, and any page containing that comment would\n\t      not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter\n\t      a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to\n\t      deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on\n\t      databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.</li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
