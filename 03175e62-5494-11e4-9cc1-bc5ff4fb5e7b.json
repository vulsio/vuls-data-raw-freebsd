This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service\n\t    attack. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.1 server implementations\n\t    for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of whether SRTP is used\n\t    or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that have been\n\t    compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.\n\t    [CVE-2014-3513].</p>\n\t  <p>When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session\n\t    ticket the integrity of that ticket is first verified.\n\t    In the event of a session ticket integrity check failing,\n\t    OpenSSL will fail to free memory causing a memory leak.\n\t    By sending a large number of invalid session tickets an\n\t    attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\n\t    attack. [CVE-2014-3567].</p>\n\t  <p>OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow\n\t    applications to block the ability for a MITM attacker to\n\t    force a protocol downgrade.</p>\n\t  <p>Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect\n\t    using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability\n\t    bugs in older servers. This could be exploited by an active\n\t    man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even\n\t    if both sides of the connection support higher protocols.\n\t    SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses including POODLE\n\t    [CVE-2014-3566].</p>\n\t  <p>When OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option,\n\t    servers could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and\n\t    clients could be configured to send them. [CVE-2014-3568].</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      "
